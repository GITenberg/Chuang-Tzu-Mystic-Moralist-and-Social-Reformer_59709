<h2><i>Introduction.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Chuang Tzŭ<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span> belongs to the third and fourth
centuries before Christ. He lived in the feudal
age, when China was split up into a number of States
owning a nominal allegiance to the royal, and weakly,
House of Chou.</p>

<p>He is noticed by the historian Ssŭ-ma Ch'ien, who
flourished at the close of the second century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Chuang Tzŭ was a native of Mêng.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> His personal
name was Chou. He held a petty official
post at Ch'i-yüan in Mêng.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> He lived contemporaneously
with Prince Hui of the Liang State and
Prince Hsüan of the Ch'i State. His erudition was
most varied; but his chief doctrines are based upon
the sayings of Lao Tzŭ.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Consequently, his writings,
which extend to over 100,000 words, are mostly
allegorical.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>He wrote <cite>The Old Fisherman</cite>, <cite>Robber Chê</cite>, and
<cite>Opening Trunks</cite>, with a view to asperse the Confucian
school and to glorify the mysteries of Lao
Tzŭ.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> <em>Wei Lei Hsü</em>, <em>Kêng Saṅg Tzŭ</em>, and the like,
are probably unsubstantial figments of his imagination.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Nevertheless, his literary and dialectic skill
was such that the best scholars of the age proved
unable to refute his destructive criticism of the
Confucian and Mihist schools.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>His teachings were like an overwhelming flood,
which spreads at its own sweet will. Consequently,
from rulers and ministers downwards, none could
apply them to any definite use.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Prince Wei of the Ch'u State, hearing of Chuang
Tzŭ's good report, sent messengers to him, bearing
costly gifts, and inviting him to become Prime
Minister. At this Chuang Tzŭ smiled and said
to the messengers, "You offer me great wealth
and a proud position indeed; but have you never
seen a sacrificial ox?&mdash;When after being fattened
up for several years, it is decked with embroidered
trappings and led to the altar, would it not willingly
then change places with some uncared-for pigling?...
Begone! Defile me not! I would
rather disport myself to my own enjoyment in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
mire than be slave to the ruler of a State. I will
never take office. Thus I shall remain free to
follow my own inclinations."<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p></div>

<p>To enable the reader to understand more fully the
writings of Chuang Tzŭ, and to appreciate his aim and
object, it will be necessary to go back a few more hundred
years.</p>

<p>In the seventh century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, lived a man, now commonly
spoken of as Lao Tzŭ. He was the great Prophet of
his age. He taught men to return good for evil, and to
look forward to a higher life. He professed to have
found the clue to all things human and divine.</p>

<p>He seems to have insisted that his system could not be
reduced to words. At any rate, he declared that those
who spoke did not know, while those who knew did not
speak.</p>

<p>But to accommodate himself to conditions of mortality,
he called this clue TAO, or <span class="smcap">The Way</span>, explaining that the
word was to be understood metaphorically, and not in a
literal sense as the way or road upon which men walk.</p>

<p>The following are sentences selected from the indisputably
genuine remains of Lao Tzŭ, to be found scattered
here and there in early Chinese literature:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All the world knows that the goodness of doing
good is not real goodness.</p>

<p>When merit has been achieved, do not take
it to yourself. On the other hand, if you do not
take it to yourself, it shall never be taken from you.</p>

<p>By many words wit is exhausted. It is better
to preserve a mean.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>Keep behind, and you shall be put in front.
Keep out, and you shall be kept in.</p>

<p>What the world reverences may not be treated
with irreverence.</p>

<p>Good words shall gain you honour in the market-place.
Good deeds shall gain you friends among
men.</p>

<p>He who, conscious of being strong, is content
to be weak,&mdash;he shall be a cynosure of men.</p>

<p>The Empire is a divine trust, and may not be
ruled. He who rules, ruins. He who holds by
force, loses.</p>

<p>Mighty is he who conquers himself.</p>

<p>He who is content, has enough.</p>

<p>To the good I would be good. To the not-good
I would also be good, in order to make them good.</p>

<p>If the government is tolerant, the people will be
without guile. If the government is meddling,
there will be constant infraction of the law.</p>

<p>Recompense injury with kindness.</p>

<p>The wise man's freedom from grievance is
because he will not regard grievances as such.</p></div>

<p>Of such were the pure and simple teachings of Lao
Tzŭ. But it is upon the wondrous doctrine of <em>Inaction</em>
that his claim to immortality is founded:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Do nothing, and all things will be done.</p>

<p>I do nothing, and my people become good of
their own accord.</p>

<p>Abandon wisdom and discard knowledge, and
the people will be benefited an hundredfold.</p>

<p>The weak overcomes the strong, the soft overcomes
the hard. All the world knows this; yet
none can act up to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></p>

<p>The softest things in the world override the
hardest. That which has no substance enters
where there is no fissure. And so I know that
there is advantage in <em>Inaction</em>.</p></div>

<p>Such doctrines as these were, however, not likely to
appeal with force to the sympathies of a practical people.
In the sixth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, before Lao Tzŭ's death, another
Prophet arose. He taught his countrymen that <em>duty to
one's neighbour</em> comprises the whole duty of man.
Charitableness of heart, justice, sincerity, and fortitude,&mdash;sum
up the ethics of Confucius. He knew nothing of a
God, of a soul, of an unseen world. And he declared
that the unknowable had better remain untouched.</p>

<p>Against these hard and worldly utterances, Chuang Tzŭ
raised a powerful cry. The idealism of Lao Tzŭ had
seized upon his poetic soul, and he determined to stem
the tide of materialism in which men were being fast
rolled to perdition.</p>

<p>He failed, of course. It was, indeed, too great a task to
persuade the calculating Chinese nation that by doing
nothing, all things would be done. But Chuang Tzŭ
bequeathed to posterity a work which, by reason of its
marvellous literary beauty, has always held a foremost
place. It is also a work of much originality of thought.
The writer, it is true, appears chiefly as a disciple insisting
upon the principles of a Master. But he has contrived to
extend the field, and carry his own speculations into regions
never dreamt of by Lao Tzŭ.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It may here be mentioned that the historian Ssŭ-ma
Ch'ien, already quoted, states in his notice of Lao Tzŭ
that the latter left behind him a small volume in 5,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
and odd characters. Ssŭ-ma Ch'ien does not say, nor
does he give the reader to understand, that he himself had
ever seen the book in question. Nor does he even hint
(see p. v.) that Chuang Tzŭ drew his inspiration from a
book, but only from the "sayings" of Lao Tzŭ.</p>

<p>Confucius never mentions this book. Neither does
Mencius, China's "Second Sage," who was born about
one hundred years after the death of the First.</p>

<p>But all this is a trifle compared with the fact that
Chuang Tzŭ himself never once alludes to such a book;
although now, in this nineteenth century, there are some,
happily few in number, who believe that we possess the
actual work of Lao Tzŭ's pen. It is, perhaps, happier
still that this small number cannot be said to include
within it the name of a single native scholar of eminence.
In fact, as far as I know, the whole range of Chinese
literature yields but the name of one such individual
who has ever believed in the genuineness of the so-called
<cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Even he would probably have remained
unknown to fame, had he not been brother to Su
Tung-p'o.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Chuang Tzŭ, indeed, puts into the mouth of Lao Tzŭ
sayings which are now found in the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>, mixed
up with a great many other similar sayings which are
not to be found there. But he also puts sayings, which
now appear in the Tao-Tê-Ching, into the mouth of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>Confucius (p. <a href="#Page_275">275</a>)! And even into the mouth of the
Yellow Emperor (pp. <a href="#Page_277">277-278</a>), whose date is some
twenty centuries earlier than that of Lao Tzŭ himself!!</p>

<p>Two centuries before the Christian era, an attempt was
made to destroy, with some exceptions, the whole of
Chinese literature, in order that history might begin anew
from the reign of the First Emperor of united China.
The extent of the actual mischief done by this "Burning
of the Books" has been greatly exaggerated. Still, the
mere attempt at such a holocaust gave a fine chance to
the scholars of the later Han dynasty (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 25-221), who
seem to have enjoyed nothing so much as forging, if not
the whole, at any rate portions, of the works of ancient
authors. Some one even produced a treatise under the
name of Lieh Tzŭ, a philosopher mentioned by Chuang
Tzŭ, not seeing that the individual in question was a
creation of Chuang Tzŭ's brain!</p>

<p>And the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite> was undoubtedly pieced together
somewhere about this period, from recorded sayings and
conversations of Lao Tzŭ.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Chuang Tzŭ's work has suffered in like manner. Several
chapters are clearly spurious, and many episodes have
been interpolated by feeble imitators of an inimitable
style.</p>

<p>The text, as it now stands, consists of thirty-three
chapters. These are a reduction from fifty-three, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>appear to have been in existence in the fourth century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span><a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
The following is the account given in the Imperial Catalogue
of the first known edition:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Chuang Tzŭ, with Commentary, in 10 books. By
Kuo Hsiang of the Chin dynasty (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 265-420).</p>

<p>The <cite>Shih-shuo-hsin-yü</cite><a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> states that Kuo Hsiang
stole his work from Hsiang Hsiu.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Subsequently,
Hsiang Hsiu's edition was issued, and the two were
in circulation together. Hsiang Hsiu's edition is
now lost, while Kuo Hsiang's remains.</p>

<p>Comparison with quotations from Hsiang Hsiu's
work, as given in <cite>Chuang Tzŭ Explained</cite>, by Lu
Tê-ming, shows conclusive evidence of plagiarism.
Nevertheless, Kuo Hsiang contributed a certain
amount of independent revision, making it impossible
for us to regard the whole as from the hand of
Hsiang Hsiu. Consequently, it now passes under
the name of Kuo Hsiang.</p></div>

<p>Since Kuo Hsiang's time, numberless editions with
ever-varying interpretations have been produced to delight
and to confuse the student. Of these, I have chosen six,
representative as nearly as possible of different schools of
thought. Their editors are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Kuo Hsiang</span> of the Chin dynasty. (<i>a</i>) As given
in the <cite>Shih Tzŭ Ch'üan Shu</cite>, or Complete Works of the
Ten Philosophers. (<i>b</i>) As edited by Tan Yüan-ch'un, of
the Ming dynasty, with his own valuable notes.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lü Hui-ch'ing</span> of the Sung dynasty.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
<p>3.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lin Hsi-yi</span> of the Sung dynasty.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wang Yü</span> of the Sung dynasty. Son of the famous
Wang An-shih.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hsing Tung</span>, a Taoist priest of the Ming dynasty.</p>

<p>6.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lin Hsi-chung</span>, of the Ming and Ch'ing dynasties.</p></div>

<p>Where there is a consensus of opinion, I have followed
such interpretation without demur. But where opinions
differ, I have not hesitated to accept that interpretation
which seemed to me to be most in harmony with the
general tenor of Chuang Tzŭ's philosophy. And where
all commentators fail equally, as they sometimes do, to
yield anything at all intelligible, I have then ventured to
fall back upon what Chuang Tzŭ himself would have
called the "light of nature." Always keeping steadily in
view the grand precept of Lin Hsi-chung, that we should
attempt to interpret Chuang Tzŭ neither according to Lao
Tzŭ, nor according to Confucius, nor according to Buddha,
but according to Chuang Tzŭ himself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of the thirty-three existing chapters, the first seven are
called "inside" chapters, the next fifteen "outside," and
the remaining eleven "miscellaneous."</p>

<p>The meaning of "inside" and "outside" is a matter of
dispute. Some Chinese critics have understood these
terms in the obvious sense of esoteric and exoteric. But
it is simpler to believe with others that the titles of the
first seven chapters are taken from the inside or subject-matter,
while the outside chapters are so named because
their titles are derived casually from words which happen
to stand at the beginning or outside of each.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span></p>

<p>Compared with the "miscellaneous," these latter seem
to have been classed together as elucidating a single
principle in terms more easy of apprehension; while the
"miscellaneous" chapters embrace several distinct trains
of thought, and are altogether more abstruse. The
arrangement is unscientific, and it was probably this which
caused Su Tung-p'o to decide that division into chapters
belongs to a later age. He regards chaps. xxix-xxxii as
spurious, although Ssŭ-ma Ch'ien alludes to two of these
as Chuang Tzŭ's work. It has indeed been held that the
inside chapters alone (i-vii) are from Chuang Tzŭ's own
pen. But most of the other chapters, exclusive of
xxix-xxxii, contain unmistakable traces of a master hand.
Ch. xvii, by virtue of an exquisite imagery, has earned
for its author the affectionate sobriquet of "Chou of the
Autumn Floods."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Chuang Tzŭ, it must be remembered, has been for
centuries classed as a heterodox writer. His work was
an effort of reaction against the materialism of Confucian
teachings. And in the course of it he was anything but
sparing of terms. Confucius is dealt with in language
which no modern literate can approve. But the beauty
and vigour of the language are facts admitted by all. He
is constantly quoted in the great standard lexicon which
passes under the name of K'ang Hsi.</p>

<p>But no acquaintance with the philosophy of Chuang
Tzŭ would assist the candidate for honours at the competitive
examinations which are the portals to official place
and power. Consequently, Chuang Tzŭ is studied chiefly
by older men, who have retired from office, or who have
been disappointed in their career. Those too who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
dominated by a religious craving for something better
than mortality, find in his pages much agreeable solace
against the troubles of this world, with an implied promise
of another and a better world to come.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It has been publicly announced that translations of Lao
Tzŭ and Chuang Tzŭ are to appear among the <cite>Sacred
Books of the East</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Now to include the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite> in such a series would
be already a doubtful step. Apart from spuriousness, it
can only by a severe stretch of courtesy be termed a
"sacred book." It undoubtedly contains many of Lao
Tzŭ's sayings, but it also undoubtedly contains much that
Lao Tzŭ never said and never could have said. It illustrates
rather that period when the pure <span class="smcap">Tao</span> of Lao Tzŭ
began to be corrupted by alchemistic research and gropings
after the elixir of life. It was probably written up in self-defence
against the encroachments of Buddhism, in those
early days of religious struggle when China was first
flooded with the "sacred books" of the West. It is not
seriously recognised as the Canon of ancient Taoism.
Among the Taoists of to-day, not one in ten thousand has
more than heard its name. For modern Taoism is but a
hybrid superstition,&mdash;a mixture of ancient nature-worship
and Buddhistic ceremonial, with <span class="smcap">Tao</span> as the style of the
firm. Its teachings are farther removed from the <span class="smcap">Tao</span>
of Lao Tzŭ than Ritualism from the Christianity of
Christ.</p>

<p>As to Chuang Tzŭ, his work can in no sense be called
"sacred." Unless indeed we modify somewhat the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>accepted value of terms, and reckon the works of Aristotle
among the "sacred" books of the Greeks. Chuang Tzŭ
was scarcely the founder of a school. He was not a
Prophet, as Lao Tzŭ was, nor can he fairly be said ever
to have been regarded by genuine Taoists as such.</p>

<p>When, many centuries later, the light of Lao Tzŭ's real
teachings had long since been obscured, then a foolish
Emperor conferred upon Chuang Tzŭ's work the title of
<cite>Holy Canon of Nan-hua</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> But this was done solely to
secure for the follies of the age the sanction of a great
name. Not to mention that Lieh Tzŭ's alleged work, and
many other similar forgeries have also been equally
honoured. So that if works like these are to be included
among the <cite>Sacred Books of the East</cite>, then China alone will
be able to supply matter for translation for the next few
centuries to come.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Partly of necessity, and partly to spare the general
reader, I have relegated to a supplement all textual and
critical notes involving the use of Chinese characters.
This supplement will be issued as soon as possible after
my return to China. It will not form an integral part of
the present work, being intended merely to assist students
of the language in verifying the renderings I have here
seen fit to adopt. As a compromise I have supplied a
kind of running commentary, introduced, in accordance
with the Chinese system, into the body of the text. It is
hoped that this will enable any one to understand the
drift of Chuang Tzŭ's allusions, and to follow arguments
which are usually subtle and oft-times obscure.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span></p>
<p>Only one previous attempt has been made to place
Chuang Tzŭ in the hands of English readers.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> In that
case, the knowledge of the Chinese language possessed by
the translator was altogether too elementary to justify
such an attempt.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<h3><i>Note on the Philosophy of Chaps.</i> i-vii.</h3>
</div>

<p class="ph3"><i>By the</i> <span class="smcap">Rev.</span> AUBREY MOORE,</p>

<p class="ph4">Tutor of Keble and Magdalen Colleges, Oxford; Hon. Canon of Christ Church, &amp;c.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> translator of Chuang Tzŭ has asked me to append a note on the
philosophy of chs. i-vii. It is difficult to see how one who writes not only
in ignorance of Chinese modes of thought, but with the preconceptions of
Western philosophy, can really help much towards the understanding of
an admittedly obscure system, involving terms and expressions on which
Chinese scholars are not yet agreed. But an attempt to point out
parallelisms of thought and reasoning between East and West may be of
use in two ways. It may stimulate those who are really competent to
understand both terms in the comparison to tell us where the parallelism
is real and where it is only apparent; and it may help to accustom
ordinary readers to look for and expect resemblances in systems in which
an earlier age would have seen nothing but contrasts.</p>

<p>There was a time when historians of Greek philosophy used to point out
what were considered to be the characteristics of Greek thought, and then
to put down to "Oriental influence" anything which did not at once agree
with these characteristics. How and through what channels this "Oriental
influence" was exercised, it was never easy to determine, nor was it
always thought worthy of much discussion. In recent times, however,
a greater knowledge of Eastern systems has familiarised us with much
which, on the same principle, ought to be attributed to "Greek influence."
And the result has been that we have learned to put aside theories of
derivation, and to content ourselves with tracing the evolution of reason
and of rational problems, and to expect parallelisms even where the circumstances
are widely different.</p>

<p>One instance may be worth quoting in illustration. We used to be
told that the Greek mind, in its speculation and its art, was characterised
by its love of order, harmony, and symmetry, in contrast with the monstrous
creations of the Oriental imagination, and the "colossal ugliness of the
Pyramids"; and it was said with reason that the Aristotelian doctrine of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
"the mean" was the ripe fruit of the practical inquiries of the Greeks,
and was the ethical counterpart of their artistic development. But in
1861 we were introduced by Dr. Legge to a Confucianist work, attributed
to Tzŭ Tzŭ, grandson of Confucius and a contemporary of Socrates,
and entitled <cite>The Doctrine of the Mean</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> which is there represented as
the true moral way in which the perfect man walks, while all else go
beyond or fall short of it. Yet even those who discovered the doctrine
of the Trinity in the Tâo-Tê-Ching have not, we believe, suggested
that Aristotle had private access to the <cite>Li Chi</cite>.</p>

<p>We may then, without bringing any charge of piracy or plagiarism
against either, point out some parallels between Chuang Tzŭ and a great
Greek thinker.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Chuang Tzŭ's first chapter is mainly critical and destructive, pointing
out the worthlessness of ordinary judgments, and the unreality of sense
knowledge. The gigantic Rukh, at the height of 90,000 <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i>, is a mere
mote in the sunbeam. For size is relative. The cicada, which can just
fly from tree to tree, laughs with the dove at the Rukh's high flight. For
space also is relative. Compared with the mushroom of a day, P'êng Tsu
is as old as Methuselah; but what is his age to that of the fabled tree,
whose spring and autumn make up 16,000 years? Time, then, is relative
too. And though men wonder at him who could "ride upon the wind
and travel for many days," he is but a child to one who "roams through
the realms of For-Ever."</p>

<p>This doctrine of "relativity," which is a commonplace in Greek as it
is in modern philosophy, is made the basis, both in ancient and modern
times, of two opposite conclusions. Either it is argued that all sense
knowledge is relative, and sense is the only organ of knowledge, therefore
real knowledge is impossible; or else the relativity of sense knowledge
leads men to draw a sharp contrast between sense and reason and to turn
away from the outward in order to listen to the inward voice. The one
alternative is scepticism, the other idealism. In Greek thought the
earliest representatives of the former are the Sophists, of the latter
Heracleitus.</p>

<p>There is no doubt to which side of the antithesis Chuang Tzŭ belongs.
His exposure of false and superficial thinking looks at first like the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>destruction of knowledge. Even Socrates was called a Sophist because of
his destructive criticism and his restless challenging of popular views.
But Chuang Tzŭ has nothing of the sceptic in him. He is an idealist and
a mystic, with all the idealist's hatred of a utilitarian system, and the
mystic's contempt for a life of mere external activity. "The perfect man
ignores <em>self</em>; the divine man ignores <em>action</em>; the true sage ignores <em>reputation</em>"
(p. <a href="#Page_5">5</a>). The Emperor Yao would have abdicated in favour of a
hermit, but the hermit replies that "reputation is but the shadow of reality,"
and will not exchange the real for the seeming. But greater than Yao
and the hermit is the divine being who dwells on the mysterious mountain
in a state of pure, passionless inaction.</p>

<p>For the sage, then, life means death to all that men think life, the
life of <em>seeming</em> or reputation, of <em>doing</em> or action, of <em>being</em> or individual selfhood.
This leads on to the "budget of paradoxes" in chap. <span class="smcap">II.</span> As in
the moral and active region we escape from the world and self, and are able
to reverse and look down upon the world's judgments, so in the speculative
region we get behind and beyond the contradictions of ordinary thinking,
and of speech which stereotypes abstractions. The sage knows nothing
of the distinction between subjective and objective. It exists only
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex analogiâ hominis</i>. "From the standpoint of Tao" all things are one.
People "guided by the criteria of their own mind," see only the contradiction,
the manifoldness, the difference; the sage sees the many
disappearing in the One, in which subjective and objective, positive and
negative, here and there, somewhere and nowhere, meet and blend. For
him, "a beam and a pillar are identical. So are ugliness and beauty,
greatness, wickedness, perverseness, and strangeness. Separation is the same
as construction: construction is the same as destruction" (pp. <a href="#Page_19">19-20</a>).
The sage "blends everything into one harmonious whole, rejecting the
comparison of this and that. Rank and precedence, which the vulgar
prize, the sage stolidly ignores. The universe itself may pass away, but
he will flourish still" (p. <a href="#Page_29">29</a>). "Were the ocean itself scorched up, he
would not feel hot. Were the milky way frozen hard he would not feel
cold. Were the mountains to be riven with thunder, and the great deep
to be thrown up by storm, he would not tremble" (pp. <a href="#Page_27">27-28</a>).</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">Si fractus illabatur orbis,</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">Impavidum ferient ruinæ.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He is "embraced in the obliterating unity of God," and passing into the
realm of the Infinite finds rest therein (p. <a href="#Page_31">31</a>).</p>

<p>It is impossible in reading this chapter on "The Identity of Contraries"
not to be reminded of Heracleitus. The disparagement of sense knowledge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
and the contempt for common views is indeed equally marked in
Eleaticism, and there is much in Chuang Tzŭ which recalls Parmenides,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
so far as the contrast between the way of truth and the way of error, the
true belief in the One and the popular belief in the Many, is concerned.
But it seems to me that the "One" of Chuang Tzŭ is not the dead Unit
of Eleaticism, which resulted from the thinking away of differences,
but the living Unity of Heracleitus, in which contraries co-exist.
Heracleitus, indeed, seems to have been a man after Chuang Tzŭ's own
heart, not only in his obscurity, which won for him the title of ὁ σκοτεινὸς,
but in his indifference to worldly position, shown in the fact that, like the
Emperor Yao, he abdicates in his brother's favour (<cite>Diog. Laert.</cite> ix. 1),
and in his supercilious disregard for the learned like Hesiod and Pythagoras
and Xenophanes and Hecataeus,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> no less than for the common
people<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> of his day.</p>

<p>"Listen," says Heracleitus, "not to me, but to reason, and confess the
true wisdom that 'All things are <span class="smcap">One</span>.'"<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> "All is One, the divided and
the undivided, the begotten and the unbegotten, the mortal and the immortal,
reason and eternity, father and son, God and justice."<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> "Cold is
hot, heat is cold, that which is moist is parched, that which is dried up is
wet."<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> "Good and evil are the same."<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> "Gods are mortal, men immortal:

"Life and death, sleeping and waking, youth and age are identical."<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>This is what reason tells the philosopher. "All is <span class="smcap">One</span>." The world
is a unity of opposing forces (παλίντροπος ἁρμονίη κόσμου ὅκωσπερ λύρας

"God is day-night, winter-summer, war-peace, repletion-want."<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The

the harmony which is seen."<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> For they live in the external, the commonplace,
the relative, and never rise above the life of the senses. "The sow
loves the mire."<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> "The ass prefers fodder to gold."<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> And men love their

<p>Of the fragments which remain to us of Heracleitus, the greater number
belong to the region of logic and metaphysics, while Chuang Tzŭ devotes
much space to the more practical side of the question. He not only
ridicules those who trust their senses, or measure by utilitarian standards,
or judge by the outward appearance;&mdash;he teaches them how to pass from
the seeming to the true. The wonderful carver, who could cut where the
natural joints are,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> is one who sees not with the eye of sense but with his
mind. When he is in doubt he "falls back upon eternal principles";
for he is "devoted to <span class="smcap">Tao</span>" (chap. iii). There is something of humour,
as well as much of truth, in the rebuke which Confucius, speaking <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro
hâc vice</i> as a disciple of Lao Tzŭ, administers to his self-confident follower
who wanted to "be of use." "Cultivate <em>fasting</em>;&mdash;not bodily fasting, but
the fasting of the heart." <span class="smcap">Tao</span> can only abide in the life which has got
rid of self. So the Duke of Shê is reminded that there is something
higher than duty,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> viz., <em>destiny</em>, the state, that is, in which conscious obedience
has given way to that which is instinctive and automatic. The
parable of the trees (pp. <a href="#Page_50">50-53</a>), with its result in the survival of the good-for-nothing,
is again a reversal of popular outside judgments. For as the
first part of the chapter had taught the uselessness of trying to be useful,
so the last part teaches the usefulness of being useless. And the same
thought is carried on in the next chapter, which deals with the reversal of
common opinion as to persons. Its motto is:&mdash;Judge not by the appearance.
Virtue must prevail and outward form be forgotten. The loathsome
leper Ai T'ai To is made Prime Minister by the wise Duke Ai. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>mutilated criminal is judged by Lao Tzŭ to be a greater man than Confucius.
For the criminal is mutilated in body by man, while Confucius,
though men know it not, by the judgment of God is πεπηρωμένος πρὸς
ἀρετήν.</p>

<p>This protest of Chuang Tzŭ against externality, and judging only by
the outward appearance, might easily be translated into Christian language.
For Christianity also teaches <em>inwardness</em>, and, in common with all
idealism, resents the delimitation of human life and knowledge to "the
things which are seen." In its opposition to a mere practical system like
Confucianism, Taoism must have appealed to those deeper instincts of
humanity to which Buddhism appealed some centuries later. In practice,
Confucianism was limited to the finite. Action, effort, benevolence,
unselfishness,&mdash;all these have a place in it, and their theatre is the world
as we know it. Its last word is worldly wisdom; not selfishness, but an
enlarged prudentialism. To the Taoist such a system savours of "the
rudiments of the world." Its "charity and duty," its "ceremonies and
music," are the "Touch not, taste not, handle not," of an ephemeral
state of being, and perish in the using. And the sage seeks for the
Absolute, the Infinite, the Eternal. He seeks to attain to <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p>

<p>It is here that we reach (in chaps. vi, vii) what properly constitutes the
<em>mysticism</em> of Chuang Tzŭ. Heracleitus is not a mystic, though he is the
founder of a long line, which through Plato, and Dionysius the Areopagite
and John the Scot in the ninth century, and Meister Eckhart in the
thirteenth, and Jacob Böhme in the sixteenth, reaches down to Hegel.
Heracleitus despises the world and shuns it; but he has not yet made
flight from the world a dogma. Even Plato, when in a well-known
passage in the Theaetetus,<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> he counsels flight from the present state of
things, explains that he means only "flee from evil and become like God."
Still less has Heracleitus got so far as to aim at self-absorption in God.
In Greek thought the attempt to get rid of consciousness, and to become
the unconscious vehicle of a higher illumination, is unknown till the time
of Philo. Yet this is the teaching of Chuang Tzŭ. "The true sage
takes his refuge in God, and learns that there is no distinction between
subject and object. This is the very axis of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>" (p. <a href="#Page_18">18</a>). Abstraction
from self, then, is the road which leads to <span class="smcap">Tao</span> (chap. vi). The pure
of old did not love life and hate death. They were content to be passive
vehicles of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. They had reached the state of sublime indifference,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>they had become "oblivious of their own existence." Everything in
them was spontaneous; nothing the result of effort. "They made no
plans; therefore failing, they had no cause for regret; succeeding, no cause
for congratulation" (p. <a href="#Page_69">69</a>). "They cheerfully played their allotted parts,
waiting patiently for the end." They were free, for they were in perfect
harmony with creation (p. <a href="#Page_71">71</a>). For them One and not One are One;
God and Man. For they had attained to <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, and <span class="smcap">Tao</span> is greater than
God. "Before heaven and earth were, <span class="smcap">Tao</span> was. It has existed without
change from all time. Spiritual beings draw their spirituality therefrom;
while the universe became what we see it now. To <span class="smcap">Tao</span> the zenith is not
high, nor the nadir low; no point of time is long ago, nor by lapse of
ages has it grown old" (p. <a href="#Page_76">76</a>). The great legislators obtained TAO, and
laid down eternal principles. The sun and moon, and the Great Bear
are kept in their courses by <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">"Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong;</div>
   <div class="verse">And the most ancient heavens, through thee, are fresh and strong."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He who would attain to <span class="smcap">Tao</span> must get rid of the thought of "charity
and duty," of "music and ceremonies," of body and mind. The flowers
and the birds do not toil, they simply live. That is <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. And for man
a state of indifference and calm, the ἀταραξία not of the sceptic but of
the mystic, a passive reflecting of the Eternal, is the ideal end. "The
perfect man employs his mind as a mirror. It grasps nothing, it refuses
nothing. It receives but does not keep. And thus he can triumph over
matter without injury to himself." (See p. <a href="#Page_98">98</a>.)</p>

<p>It would of course be presumption to attempt to assign a meaning to <span class="smcap">Tao</span>,
and still more to discover an equivalent in Western thought. But it may
be lawful to say that Heracleitus often speaks of Λόγος as Chuang
Tzŭ speaks of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. It is Necessity (ἀνάγκη), or Fate (εἱμαρμένη), or
Mind (γνώμη), or Justice (Δική). In nature it appears as balance and
equipoise; in the State as Law; in man as the universal Reason,
which is <em>in</em> him but not <em>of</em> him. Sometimes it is identified with the
mysterious name of Zeus, which may not be uttered;<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> sometimes like
the Ἀνάγκη of the Greek poets, it is supreme over gods and men. If
it is hard to say what is the relation of <span class="smcap">Tao</span> to God, it is not less hard to
define the relation of Λόγος to Zeus. To speak of Chuang Tzŭ and
Heracleitus as pantheists is only to say that, so far as we can translate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>their language into ours, that name seems less inappropriate than Theist
or Deist. But it is doubtful whether the distinction between Pantheism
and Theism would have been intelligible to either philosopher, and certain
that if they could have understood it, they would have denied to it reality.
Both held the immanence of the Eternal Principle in all that is. Both
taught that the soul is an emanation from the Divine, and both, though in
very different degrees, seem to teach that a life is perfect in proportion as it
becomes one with that from which it came, and loses what is individual
in it.</p>

<p>In Chuang Tzŭ, as in all mystics, there is an element of antinomianism. That
"good and evil are the same," may contain a deep truth for the sage, but
"take no heed of time, nor of right and wrong" (p. <a href="#Page_31">31</a>) is, to say the least,
dangerous teaching for the masses. The mystic's utterances will not bear
translation into the language of the world, and to take them <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au pied de la
lettre</i> can hardly fail to produce disastrous results. This is why antinomianism
always dogs the heels of mysticism. And this may perhaps
help to explain the debased Taoism of to-day. But of this I know
nothing.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know whether in the undisputed utterances
of Lao Tzŭ (<i>i. e.</i> putting on one side the <cite>Tâo-Tê-Ching</cite>), Quietism and
the glorification of Inaction are as prominent as they are in <cite>Chuang Tzŭ</cite>.
One would be prepared <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">à priori</i> to find that they are not. Lao Tzŭ was
born at the end of the seventh century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and was, therefore, some fifty
years older than Confucius, with whom in 517 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, he is said to have had
an interview.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> By the time of Chuang Tzŭ, who was possibly contemporary
with Mencius, and therefore some two or three centuries after Lao Tzŭ,
Confucianism had become to some extent the established religion of China,
and Taoism, like Republicanism in the days of the Roman Empire, became
a mere <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">opposition de salon</i>. Under such circumstances any elements of
mysticism latent in Lao Tzŭ's system would develop rapidly. And the antagonism
between the representatives of Lao Tzŭ and Confucius would proportionately
increase. But philosophy does not become mystical and take
refuge in flight until it abandons all hope of converting the world. When
effort is useless, the mind idealises Inaction, and seeks a metaphysical
basis for it. For mysticism and scepticism flourish in the same atmosphere
though in different soils, both, though in different ways, implying
the abandonment of the rational problem. The Sceptic, the Agnostic
or Positivist of to-day, declares it insoluble, and settles down content to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>take things as they are; the mystic retires into himself, and dreams of a
state of being which is the obverse of the world of fact.</p>

<p>The triumph of Confucianism in the centuries which intervened between
Lao Tzŭ and Chuang Tzŭ would account for the antagonism between
Taoism and Confucianism as we find it. But it fails to account for the way
in which Confucius is sometimes represented as playing into the hands of
Taoism. On p. <a href="#Page_85">85</a> f. n. the translator explains it as a literary <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de main</i>.
Dr. Chalmers, quoted by Dr. Legge,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> says that both Chuang Tzŭ and Lieh
Tzŭ introduced Confucius into their writings "as the lords of the Philistines
did the captive Samson on their festive occasions, 'to make sport for
them.'" But there is not a hint of this given in the text, though
throughout one long chapter (chap. iv) we find Confucius giving a Taoist
refutation of Confucianist doctrines when defended by his own pupil
Yen Hui. It might seem like an attempt to draw a distinction
between Confucius and Confucianism, though elsewhere Confucius is
ridiculed as wanting in sense.</p>

<p>May not the explanation be as follows?&mdash;</p>

<div class="indent">
<p>(i.) Lao Tzŭ and Confucius were probably much nearer to one another
philosophically than the Taoism of Chuang Tzŭ and the Confucianism
of Mencius. The passages in which Confucius talks Taoism would, on
this hypothesis, represent a traditional survival of their real relations to
one another. The episode of Confucius' visit to Lao Tzŭ "to ask about
the <span class="smcap">Tao</span>," would, whether it records a fact or not, tend in the same
direction.</p>

<p>(ii.) From the first we may assume that the one took an ideal, the
other a practical and utilitarian view of <span class="smcap">Tao</span> "the Way"; Confucius
finding it in social duties and the work of practical life, Lao Tzŭ in the
hidden and the <em>inward</em>, the "interior life," as Christian mystics would call
it. Thus the historian Ssŭ-ma Ch'ien<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> says, "Lao Tzŭ cultivated the
<span class="smcap">Tao</span> and virtue, his chief aim in his studies being how to keep himself
concealed and unknown. Seeing the decay of the dynasty he withdrew
himself out of sight, and no one knows where he died."</p>

<p>(iii.) The divergence between the two views, the ideal and the actual,
the mystical and the practical, would increase with time, each intensifying
the other by opposition and reaction, until the practical won its way to
security, and the mystical got left out in the cold, perhaps persecuted,
certainly suspected, and treated as heterodox, and naturally retaliating by
scornful criticism of the dominant view. When this stage is reached,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>Mencius regards Lao Tzŭ as a heresiarch, while Chuang Tzŭ often treats
Confucius with contempt and ridicule. For "the Way that is walked
upon is not the Way," and "the <span class="smcap">Tao</span> which shines forth is not <span class="smcap">Tao</span>"
(p. <a href="#Page_25">25</a>). But Confucianism being "established," the Taoists are now
"dissenters," and not being strong enough to disestablish Confucianism
become more and more mystical, and content themselves with a policy
of protest.</p>
</div>

<p>If there is little direct evidence for this theory as to the relations of
Taoism and Confucianism, there is a curious parallel in Western thought.
When Plato was known only in a neo-Platonic disguise, and Aristotle
judged by the <cite>Organon</cite>, it was possible for partisans to represent the two
philosophers as typical opposites, and to assume that "every one is born a
Platonist or an Aristotelian," forgetting that Aristotle was Plato's pupil,
and both were followers of Socrates. Later on, when Aristotelianism
became "established" as the Christian philosophy, Platonism, which
survived in the more mystical schoolmen, fell under suspicion, and not
unfrequently justified the suspicion by developing in the direction of
Pantheism. It was not till the thirteenth century that the world appealed
from Platonists and Aristotelians to Plato and Aristotle, and discovered
that the divergent streams flowed from neighbouring springs. Such an
appeal, it is to be feared, is hardly possible in the case of Lao Tzŭ and
Confucius, especially as the authenticity of the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite> is still in
controversy among Sinologues.</p>

<p>My object, however, in this note, which has grown out of all proportion,
was not to suggest a theory as to the possible relations of Lao Tzŭ
and Confucius, but to point out what seemed to be a remarkable
parallel between the teaching of Chuang Tzŭ and Heracleitus. In doing
this I have accepted Mr. Giles's translation as an ultimate fact, for the
simple reason that I do not know a single Chinese character. So far,
therefore, as the translation prejudices or prejudges questions of Chinese
scholarship, I must leave the defence to the translator. It is also possible,
and more than possible, that my Western preconceptions may have
biassed my judgment of Chuang Tzŭ's philosophical teaching. Recent
attempts<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> to draw a parallel between the life of Gautama and the life of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>Christ have shown how easy it is unconsciously to read between the lines,
and find parallelisms where they do not exist. If I have been guilty
in the same way, then, with Socrates in the Republic, I say, "I can
but suffer the penalty of ignorance; and that penalty is, to be taught
by those who know."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Argument</i>:&mdash;Space infinite&mdash;Time infinite&mdash;Relativity of magnitudes,
physical and moral&mdash;The magnitude absolute&mdash;Usefulness as a test
of value&mdash;The usefulness of the useless.</p></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> the northern ocean there is a fish, called the
Leviathan, many thousand <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i> in size. This
leviathan changes into a bird, called the Rukh,
whose back is many thousand <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i> in breadth. With
a mighty effort it rises, and its wings obscure the
sky like clouds.</p>

<p>At the equinox, this bird prepares to start for the
southern ocean, the Celestial Lake. And in the
<cite>Record of Marvels</cite> we read that when the rukh
flies southwards, the water is smitten for a space of
three thousand <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i> around, while the bird itself
mounts upon a typhoon to a height of ninety
thousand <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i>, for a flight of six months' duration.</p>

<p>Just so are the motes in a sunbeam blown aloft
by God. For whether the blue of the sky is its
real colour, or only the result of distance without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
end, the effect to the bird looking down would be
just the same as to the motes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Distance being relative. The rukh at an altitude
of 90,000 <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i> (three <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i> to a mile) is no more than a
mote in a sunbeam a few feet from the ground.</p></div>

<p>If there is not sufficient depth, water will not
float large ships. Upset a cupful into a small hole,
and a mustard-seed will be your boat. Try to float
the cup, and it will stick, from the disproportion
between water and vessel.</p>

<p>So with air. If there is not a sufficient depth,
it cannot support large birds. And for this bird a
depth of ninety thousand <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i> is necessary; and then,
with nothing save the clear sky above, and no
obstacle in the way, it starts upon its journey to
the south.</p>

<p>A cicada laughed, and said to a young dove,
"Now, when I fly with all my might, 'tis as much
as I can do to get from tree to tree. And sometimes
I do not reach, but fall to the ground midway.
What then can be the use of going up ninety
thousand <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i> in order to start for the south?"</p>

<p>He who goes to Mang-ts'ang,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A short distance into the country.</p></div>

<p>taking three meals with him, comes back with his
stomach as full as when he started. But he who
travels a hundred <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i> must grind flour enough for
a night's halt. And he who travels a thousand
<i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i> must supply himself with provisions for three
months. Those two little creatures,&mdash;what should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
they know? Small knowledge has not the compass
of great knowledge any more than a short year has
the length of a long year.</p>

<p>How can we tell that this is so? The mushroom
of a morning knows not the alternation of day
and night. The chrysalis knows not the alternation
of spring and autumn. Theirs are short
years.</p>

<p>But in the State of Ch'u there is a tortoise
whose spring and autumn are each of five hundred
years' duration. And in former days there was a
large tree which had a spring and autumn each of
eight thousand years' duration. Yet, P'êng Tsu</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Methusaleh of China. His age has not been
agreed upon by Chinese writers, but the lowest
computation gives him a life of eight hundred years.</p></div>

<p>is still, alas! an object of envy to all.</p>

<p>It was on this very subject that the Emperor
T'ang</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>B.C. 1766.</p></div>

<p>spoke to Chi, as follows:&mdash;"At the barren north
there is a great sea, the Celestial Lake. In it there
is a fish, several thousand <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i> in breadth, and I
know not how many in length. It is called the
Leviathan. There is also a bird, called the Rukh,
with a back like Mount T'ai,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>China's most famous mountain, situated in the
province of Shantung.</p></div>

<p>and wings like clouds across the sky. Upon a
typhoon it soars up to a height of ninety thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
<i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i>, beyond the clouds and atmosphere, with only the
clear sky above it. And then it directs its flight
towards the south pole.</p>

<p>"A quail laughed, and said: Pray, what may
that creature be going to do? I rise but a few
yards in the air, and settle again after flying around
among the reeds. That is the most I can manage.
Now, where ever can this creature be going to?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The repetition of this story, coupled with its quotation
from the <cite>Record of Marvels</cite>, is considered to
give an air of authenticity to Chuang Tzŭ's illustration,
which the reader might otherwise suppose to
be of his own invention.</p></div>

<p>Such, indeed, is the difference between small and
great. Take, for instance, a man who creditably
fills some small office, or who is a pattern of virtue
in his neighbourhood, or who influences his prince
to right government of the State,&mdash;his opinion of
himself will be much the same as that quail's. The
philosopher Yung laughs at such a one. He, if the
whole world flattered him, would not be affected
thereby, nor if the whole world blamed him would
he lose his faith in himself. For Yung can distinguish
between the intrinsic and the extrinsic,
between honour and shame,&mdash;and such men are
rare in their generation. But even he has not
established himself.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Beyond the limits of an external world. His
achievements are after all only of the earth, earthy.</p></div>

<p>There was Lieh Tzŭ again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>A personage of whom nothing is really known.
He is considered by the best authorities to have been
of Chuang Tzŭ's own creation. This, however, did
not prevent some enterprising scholar, probably of
the Han dynasty, from discovering a treatise which
still passes under Lieh Tzŭ's name.</p></div>

<p>He could ride upon the wind, and travel whithersoever
he wished, staying away as long as fifteen
days. Among mortals who attain happiness, such
a man is rare. Yet although Lieh Tzŭ was able
to dispense with walking, he was still dependent
upon something.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Sc.</i> the wind.</p></div>

<p>But had he been charioted upon the eternal fitness
of Heaven and Earth, driving before him the

realms of For-Ever,&mdash;upon what, then, would he
have had to depend?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That is, nourished upon the doctrines of inaction,
the continuity of life and death, etc., which will be
dealt with in later chapters.</p></div>

<p>Thus it has been said, "The perfect man ignores

ignores <em>reputation</em>."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His&mdash;for the three are one&mdash;is a bliss "beyond all

into thin air; worldly joys and sorrows cease for him
who passes thus into the everlasting enjoyment of a
transcendental peace.</p></div>

<p>The Emperor Yao</p>

<p>wished to abdicate in favour of Hsü Yu,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A worthy hermit.</p></div>

<p>saying, "If, when the sun and moon are shining,
you persist in lighting a torch, is not that a misapplication
of fire? If, when the rainy season is at
its height, you still continue to water the ground,
is not this a waste of labour? Now, sir, do you
assume the reins of government, and the empire will
be at peace. I am but a dead body, conscious of my
own deficiency. I beg you will ascend the throne."</p>

<p>"Ever since you, sire, have directed the administration,"
replied Hsü Yu, "the empire has enjoyed
tranquillity. Supposing, therefore, that I were to
take your place now, should I gain any reputation
thereby? Besides, reputation is but the shadow of
reality; and should I trouble myself about the
shadow? The tit, building its nest in the mighty
forest, occupies but a single twig. The tapir slakes
its thirst from the river, but drinks enough only to
fill its belly. To you, sire, belongs the reputation:
the empire has no need for me. If a cook is unable
to dress his funeral sacrifices, the boy who
impersonates the corpse may not step over the
wines and meats and do it for him."</p>

<p>This illustrates rejection of reputation by the true

<p>Chien Wu said to Lien Shu,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>"I heard Chieh Yü utter something unjustifiably
extravagant and without either rhyme or reason.</p>

<p>This was an individual, named Lu T'ung, who feigned
madness in order to escape an official career. For
his interview with Confucius, see <a href="#Page_38">ch. iv</a>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad fin.</i></p></div>

<p>I was greatly startled at what he said, for it seemed
to me boundless as the Milky Way, though very
improbable and removed from the experiences of
mortals."</p>

<p>"What was it?" asked Lien Shu.</p>

<p>"He declared," replied Chien Wu, "that on the
Miao-ku-shê mountain</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Which is as fabulous as the story.</p></div>

<p>there lives a divine man whose flesh is like ice or
snow, whose demeanour is that of a virgin, who
eats no fruit of the earth, but lives on air and dew,
and who, riding on clouds with flying dragons for
his team, roams beyond the limits of mortality.
This being is absolutely inert. Yet he wards off
corruption from all things, and causes the crops to
thrive. Now I call that nonsense, and do not
believe it."</p>

<p>"Well," answered Lien Shu, "you don't ask a
blind man's opinion of a picture, nor do you invite
a deaf man to a concert. And blindness and deafness
are not physical only. There is blindness and
deafness of the mind, diseases from which I fear
you yourself are suffering. The good influence
of that man fills all creation. Yet because a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
paltry generation cries for reform, you would have
him condescend to the details of an empire!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Not seeing that the greater contains the less.</p></div>

<p>"Objective existences cannot harm him. In a
flood which reached to the sky, he would not
be drowned. In a drought, though metals ran
liquid and mountains were scorched up, he would
not be hot. Out of his very dust and siftings
you might fashion two such men as Yao and
Shun. And you would have him occupy himself
with objectives!"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Illustrating the inaction of the divine man.</p></div>

<p>A man of the Sung State carried some sacrificial
caps into the Yüeh State, for sale. But the
men of Yüeh used to cut off their hair and paint
their bodies, so that they had no use for such
things. And so, when the Emperor Yao, the
ruler of all under heaven and pacificator of all
within the shores of ocean, paid a visit to the
four sages of the Miao-ku-shê mountain, on returning
to his capital at Fên-yang, the empire
existed for him no more.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This illustrates the rejection of self by the perfect
man. Yao had his eyes opened to the hollowness
and uselessness of all mortal possessions. He ceased,
therefore, to think any more of himself, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per
consequens</i> of the empire.</p></div>

<p>Hui Tzŭ</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>A celebrated schoolman, contemporary with and
antagonistic to Chuang Tzŭ. For an account of his
theories, see <a href="#Page_437">ch. xxxiii</a>.</p></div>

<p>said to Chuang Tzŭ, "The Prince of Wei gave me
a seed of a large-sized kind of gourd. I planted it,
and it bore a fruit as big as a five-bushel measure.
Now had I used this for holding liquids, it
would have been too heavy to lift; and had I cut
it in half for ladles, the ladles would have been ill
adapted for such purpose. It was uselessly large,
so I broke it up."</p>

<p>"Sir," replied Chuang Tzŭ, "it was rather you
who did not know how to use large things. There
was a man of Sung who had a recipe for salve for
chapped hands, his family having been silk-washers
for generations. Well, a stranger who had heard
of it, came and offered him 100 <i>oz.</i> of silver for
this recipe; whereupon he called together his
clansmen and said, 'We have never made much
money by silk-washing. Now, we can make 100 <i>oz.</i>
in a single day. Let the stranger have the recipe.'</p>

<p>"So the stranger got it, and went and informed
the Prince of Wu who was just then at war with
the Yüeh State. Accordingly, the Prince used it
in a naval battle fought at the beginning of winter
with the Yüeh State, the result being that the
latter was totally defeated.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They suffered from chapped hands, while their
rivals of the Wu State were protected by their
patent salve.</p></div>

<p>The stranger was rewarded with territory and a
title. Thus, while the efficacy of the salve to cure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
chapped hands was in both cases the same, its
application was different. Here, it secured a title;
there, a capacity for washing silk.</p>

<p>"Now as to your five-bushel gourd, why did
you not make a boat of it, and float about
over river and lake? You could not then have
complained of its not holding anything! But I
fear you are rather woolly inside."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Like it. This, of course, is a sneer. Hui Tzŭ
could not see that the greatness of a thing depends
upon the greatness of its application.</p></div>

<p>Hui Tzŭ said to Chuang Tzŭ, "Sir, I have a
large tree, of a worthless kind. Its trunk is so
irregular and knotty that it cannot be measured
out for planks; while its branches are so twisted
as to admit of no geometrical subdivision whatever.
It stands by the roadside, but no carpenter
will look at it. And your words, sir, are like
that tree;&mdash;big and useless, not wanted by anybody."</p>

<p>"Sir," rejoined Chuang Tzŭ, "have you never
seen a wild cat, crouching down in wait for its
prey? Right and left it springs from bough to
bough, high and low alike,&mdash;until perchance it
gets caught in a trap or dies in a snare. On the
other hand, there is the yak with its great huge
body. It is big enough in all conscience, but it
cannot catch mice.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The adaptability of a thing is oft-times its bane.
The inability of the yak to catch mice saves it from
the snare which is fatal to the wild cat.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now if you have a big tree and are at a
loss what to do with it, why not plant it in the
domain of non-existence,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Beyond the limits of our external world. Referring
to the conditions of mental abstraction in which
alone true happiness is to be found.</p></div>

<p>whither you might betake yourself to inaction by
its side, to blissful repose beneath its shade?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Why does the horizon hold me fast, with my joy

<p>There it would be safe from the axe and from
all other injury; for being of no use to others,
itself would be free from harm."</p>

which is small and useful is thus shown to be inferior
to that which is large and useless.</p></div>

</div>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">The Identity of Contraries.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Argument</i>:&mdash;Contraries spring from our subjective individuality&mdash;Identity
of subjective and objective&mdash;The centre where all distinctions are
merged in <span class="smcap">One</span>&mdash;How to reach this point&mdash;Speech an obstacle&mdash;The
negative state&mdash;Light out of darkness&mdash;Illustrations.</p></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Tzŭ Ch'i</span> of Nan-kuo sat leaning on a table.
Looking up to heaven, he sighed and became
absent, as though soul and body had parted.</p>

<p>Yen Ch'êng Tzŭ Yu, who was standing by
him, exclaimed, "What are you thinking about
that your body should become thus like dry
wood, your mind like dead ashes? Surely the
man now leaning on the table is not he who was
here just now."</p>

<p>"My friend," replied Tzŭ Ch'i, "your question
is apposite. <em>To-day I have buried myself</em>....
Do you understand?... Ah! perhaps you only
know the music of Man, and not that of Earth.
Or even if you have heard the music of Earth,
you have not heard the music of Heaven."</p>

<p>"Pray explain," said Tzŭ Yu.</p>

<p>"The breath of the universe," continued Tzŭ
Ch'i, "is called wind. At times, it is inactive.
But when active, every aperture resounds to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
blast. Have you never listened to its growing
roar?</p>

<p>"Caves and dells of hill and forest, hollows
in huge trees of many a span in girth;&mdash;these
are like nostrils, like mouths, like ears,
like beam-sockets, like goblets, like mortars, like
ditches, like bogs. And the wind goes rushing
through them, sniffing, snoring, singing, soughing,
puffing, purling, whistling, whirring, now
shrilly treble, now deeply bass, now soft, now
loud; until, with a lull, silence reigns supreme.
Have you never witnessed among the trees such
a disturbance as this?"</p>

<p>"Well, then," enquired Tzŭ Yu, "since the
music of earth consists of nothing more than
holes, and the music of man of pipes and flutes,&mdash;of
what consists the music of Heaven?"</p>

<p>"The effect of the wind upon these various
apertures," replied Tzŭ Ch'i, "is not uniform.
But what is it that gives to each the individuality,
to all the potentiality, of sound?</p>

<p>"Great knowledge embraces the whole:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sees both "the upper and under side of the medal
of Jove" at once.</p></div>

<p>small knowledge, a part only. Great speech is
universal:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Speech, according to Chuang Tzŭ's ideal, always
covers the whole ground in question, leaving no room
for positive and negative to appear in antagonism.</p></div>

<p>small speech is particular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"For whether when the mind is locked in
sleep or whether when in waking hours the
body is released, we are subject to daily mental
perturbations,&mdash;indecision, want of penetration,
concealment, fretting fear, and trembling terror.
Now like a javelin the mind flies forth, the arbiter
of right and wrong.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thus recognising contraries.</p></div>

<p>Now like a solemn covenanter it remains firm, the
guardian of rights secured.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Adhering to an opinion formed.</p></div>

<p>Then, as under autumn and winter's blight, comes
gradual decay, a passing away, like the flow of
water, never to return. Finally, the block when
all is choked up like an old drain,&mdash;the failing
mind which shall not see light again.</p>

<p>"Joy and anger, sorrow and happiness, caution
and remorse, come upon us by turns, with ever-changing
mood. They come like music from
hollowness, like mushrooms from damp. Daily
and nightly they alternate within us, but we
cannot tell whence they spring. Can we then
hope in a moment to lay our finger upon their very
Cause?</p>

<p>"But for these emotions <em>I</em> should not be. But
for <em>me</em>, they would have no scope. So far we can
go; but we do not know what it is that brings them
into play. 'Twould seem to be a <em>soul</em>; but the clue
to its existence is wanting. That such a Power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
operates, is credible enough, though we cannot see
its form. It has functions without form.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As will be gathered later on, Chuang Tzŭ conceives
of the soul as an emanation from God, passing
to and from this earth through the portals of Life
and Death.</p></div>

<p>"Take the human body with all its manifold
divisions. Which part of it does a man love best?
Does he not cherish all equally, or has he a preference?
Do not all equally serve him? And do
these servitors then govern themselves, or are they
subdivided into rulers and subjects? Surely there
is some soul which sways them all.</p>

<p>"But whether or not we ascertain what are the
functions of this soul, it matters but little to the soul
itself. For coming into existence with this mortal
coil of mine, with the exhaustion of this mortal coil
its mandate will also be exhausted. To be harassed
by the wear and tear of life, and to pass rapidly
through it without possibility of arresting one's
course,&mdash;is not this pitiful indeed? To labour
without ceasing, and then, without living to enjoy
the fruit, worn out, to depart, suddenly, one
knows not whither,&mdash;is not that a just cause
for grief?</p>

<p>"What advantage is there in what men call not
dying? The body decomposes, and the mind goes
with it. This is our real cause for sorrow. Can
the world be so dull as not to see this? Or is it I
alone who am dull, and others not so?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"If we are to be guided by the criteria of our
own minds, who shall be without a guide?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The mind should be a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabula rasa</i>, free from all
judgments or opinions of its own as to the external
world, and ready only to accept things as they are,
not as they appear to be.</p></div>

<p>What need to know of the alternations of passion,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As above described.</p></div>

<p>when the mind thus affords scope to itself?&mdash;verily
even the minds of fools! Whereas, for a mind
without criteria</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As it should be.</p></div>

<p>to admit the idea of contraries, is like saying, <em>I
went to Yüeh to-day, and got there yesterday</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One of Hui Tzŭ's paradoxes. See <a href="#Page_437">ch. xxxiii</a>.</p></div>

<p>Or, like placing nowhere somewhere,&mdash;topography
which even the Great Yü</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The famous engineer of antiquity (<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 2205), who

<p>"Speech is not mere breath. It is differentiated
by meaning. Take away that, and you cannot say
whether it is speech or not. Can you even distinguish
it from the chirping of young birds?</p>

<p>"But how can <span class="smcap">Tao</span> be so obscured that we speak
of it as true and false? And how can speech be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
so obscured that it admits the idea of contraries?
How can <span class="smcap">Tao</span> go away and yet not remain?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Being omnipresent.</p></div>

<p>How can speech exist and yet be impossible?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See p. <a href="#Page_13">13</a>.</p></div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Tao</span> is obscured by our want of grasp. Speech
is obscured by the gloss of this world.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>I.e.</i> by the one-sided meanings attached to words
and phrases.</p></div>

<p>Hence the affirmatives and negatives of the Confucian
and Mihist schools,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mih Tzŭ was a philosopher of the fourth century
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, who propounded various theories which were
vigorously attacked by the Confucianists under
Mencius. We shall hear more of him by-and-by.</p></div>

<p>each denying what the other affirmed and affirming
what the other denied. But he who would reconcile
affirmative with negative and negative with
affirmative,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The "union of impossibilities," which Emerson
credits to Plato alone.</p></div>

<p>must do so by the light of nature.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>I.e.</i> Have no established mental criteria, and thus
see all things as ONE.</p></div>

<p>"There is nothing which is not objective: there
is nothing which is not subjective. But it is impossible
to start from the objective. Only from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
subjective knowledge is it possible to proceed to
objective knowledge. Hence it has been said,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By Hui Tzŭ.</p></div>

<p>'The objective emanates from the subjective; the
subjective is consequent upon the objective. This
is the <em>Alternation Theory</em>.' Nevertheless, when
one is born, the other dies. When one is possible,
the other is impossible. When one is affirmative
the other is negative. Which being the case, the
true sage rejects all distinctions of this and that.
He takes his refuge in <span class="smcap">God</span>, and places himself in
subjective relation with all things.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was to this end that Tzŭ Ch'i "buried himself."</p></div>

<p>"And inasmuch as the subjective is also objective,
and the objective also subjective, and as the
contraries under each are indistinguishably blended,
does it not become impossible for us to say whether
subjective and objective really exist at all?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What is positive under the one will be negative
under the other. Yet as subjective and objective
are really one and the same, their positives and
negatives must also be one and the same.</p>

<p>It is as though we were to view them through a
kind of mental Pseudoscope, by which means each
would appear to be the other.</p></div>

<p>"When subjective and objective are both without
their correlates, that is the very axis of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.
And when that axis passes through the centre at
which all Infinities converge, positive and negative
alike blend into an infinite <span class="smcap">One</span>. Hence it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
been said that there is nothing like the light of
nature.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Probably an allusion to Lao Tzŭ's "Use the light
that is within you to revert to your natural clearness
of sight." We should then be able to view things
in their true light. See <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>, ch. lii., and
<cite>The Remains of Lao Tzŭ</cite>, p. 34.</p></div>

<p>"To take a finger in illustration of a finger not
being a finger is not so good as to take something
which is not a finger. To take a horse in illustration
of a horse not being a horse is not so good as
to take something which is not a horse.</p>

<p>"So with the universe and all that in it is.
These things are but fingers and horses in this
sense. The possible is possible: the impossible is
impossible. <span class="smcap">Tao</span> operates, and given results
follow. Things receive names and are what they
are. They achieve this by their natural affinity for
what they are and their natural antagonism to
what they are not. For all things have their own
particular constitutions and potentialities. Nothing
can exist without these.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These last few sentences are repeated in <a href="#Page_363">ch. xxvii</a>.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad init.</i></p>

<p>"We can never know anything but phenomena.
Things are what they are, and their consequences
will be what they will be."&mdash;<cite>J. S. Mill.</cite></p></div>

<p>"Therefore it is that, viewed from the standpoint
of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, a beam and a pillar are identical.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The horizontal with the vertical.</p></div>

<p>So are ugliness and beauty, greatness, wickedness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
perverseness, and strangeness. Separation is the
same as construction: construction is the same as
destruction. Nothing is subject either to construction
or to destruction, for these conditions are
brought together into <span class="smcap">One</span>.</p>

<p>"Only the truly intelligent understand this principle
of the identity of all things. They do not
view things as apprehended by themselves, subjectively;
but transfer themselves into the position
of the things viewed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Avoiding the fallacious channels of the senses.</p></div>

<p>And viewing them thus they are able to comprehend
them, nay, to master them;&mdash;and he who can
master them is near. So it is that to place oneself
in subjective relation with externals, without consciousness
of their objectivity,&mdash;this is <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. But
to wear out one's intellect in an obstinate adherence
to the individuality of things, not recognising
the fact that all things are <span class="smcap">One</span>,&mdash;this is called
<em>Three in the Morning</em>."</p>

<p>"What is <em>Three in the Morning</em>?" asked Tzŭ Yu.</p>

<p>"A keeper of monkeys," replied Tzŭ Ch'i, "said
with regard to their rations of chestnuts that each
monkey was to have three in the morning and four
at night. But at this the monkeys were very angry,
so the keeper said they might have four in the
morning and three at night, with which arrangement
they were all well pleased. The actual
number of the chestnuts remained the same, but
there was an adaptation to the likes and dislikes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
those concerned. Such is the principle of putting
oneself into subjective relation with externals.</p>

<p>"Wherefore the true Sage, while regarding contraries
as identical, adapts himself to the laws of
Heaven. This is called following two courses at
once.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He is thus prevented from trying to walk through
walls, etc., as later Taoists have professed themselves
able to do, of course with a view to gull the public
and enrich themselves. "<span class="smcap">God</span>," says Locke, "when
he makes the prophet, does not unmake the man."</p>

<p>So Carlyle in his essay on Novalis:&mdash;"To a Transcendentalist,
matter has an existence but only as a
Phenomenon.... It is a mere relation, or rather
the result of a relation between our living souls and
the great First Cause."</p></div>

<p>"The knowledge of the men of old had a limit.
It extended back to a period when matter did not
exist. That was the extreme point to which their
knowledge reached.</p>

<p>"The second period was that of matter, but of
matter unconditioned.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By time or space. "Being, in itself," says Herbert
Spencer, "out of relation, is itself unthinkable."
<cite>Principles of Psychology</cite>, iii. p. 258.</p></div>

<p>"The third epoch saw matter conditioned, but
contraries were still unknown. When these
appeared, <span class="smcap">Tao</span> began to decline. And with the
decline of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, individual bias arose.</p>

<p>"Have then these states of falling and rising
real existences? Surely they are but as the falling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To keep time.</p></div>

<p>Hui Tzŭ argued. Herein these three men excelled,
and in the practice of such arts they passed their
lives.</p>

<p>"Hui Tzŭ's particular views being very different
from those of the world in general, he was correspondingly
anxious to enlighten people. But he
did not enlighten them as he should have done,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By the cultivation and passive manifestation of his
own inward light.</p></div>

<p>and consequently ended in the obscurity of the
'hard and white.'</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Hui Tzŭ regarded such abstractions as hardness and
whiteness as separate existences, of which the mind
could only be conscious separately, one at a time.</p></div>

<p>Subsequently, his son searched his works for some
clue, but never succeeded in establishing the principle.
And indeed if such were possible to be
established, then even I am established; but if not,
then neither I nor anything in the universe is
established!</p>

<p>"Therefore what the true Sage aims at is the
light which comes out of darkness. He does not
view things as apprehended by himself, subjectively,
but transfers himself into the position of the
things viewed. This is called using the light.</p>

<p>"There remains, however, Speech. Is that to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
enrolled under either category of contraries, or not?
Whether it is so enrolled or not, it will in any case
belong to one or the other, and thus be as though it
had an objective existence. At any rate, I should
like to hear some speech which belongs to neither
category.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Contraries being disposed of, there remains the
vehicle <em>Speech</em>, <i>i.e.</i> the actual terms in which it is
stated that contraries have ceased to be.</p></div>

<p>"If there was a beginning, then there was a time
before that beginning. And a time before the time
which was before the time of that beginning.</p>

<p>"If there is existence, there must have been non-existence.
And if there was a time when nothing
existed, then there must have been a time before
that&mdash;when even nothing did not exist. Suddenly,
when nothing came into existence, could one really
say whether it belonged to the category of existence
or of non-existence? Even the very words I have
just now uttered,&mdash;I cannot say whether they have
really been uttered or not.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>I.e.</i> The words in the text, denying the existence of
contraries.</p></div>

<p>"There is nothing under the canopy of heaven
greater than the tip of an autumn spikelet. A vast
mountain is a small thing. Neither is there any
age greater than that of a child cut off in infancy.
P'êng Tsu himself died young. The universe and
I came into being together; and I, and everything
therein, are <span class="smcap">One</span>.</p>

<p>"If then all things are <span class="smcap">One</span>, what room is there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
for Speech? On the other hand, since I can utter
these words, how can Speech not exist?</p>

<p>"If it does exist, we have <span class="smcap">One</span> and Speech = two;
and two and one = three. From which point onwards
even the best mathematicians will fail to reach:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Tao.</span></p></div>

<p>how much more then will ordinary people fail?</p>

<p>"Hence, if from nothing you can proceed to
something, and subsequently reach three, it follows
that it would be still more easy if you were to start
from something. To avoid such progression, you
must put yourself into subjective relation with the
external.</p>

<p>"Before conditions existed, <span class="smcap">Tao</span> was. Before
definitions existed, Speech was. Subjectively, we
are conscious of certain delimitations which are,&mdash;</p>

<p>
Right         and   Left<br />
Relationship  and   Obligation<br />
Division      and   Discrimination<br />
Emulation     and   Contention
</p>

<p>These are called the <em>Eight Predicables</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Not, of course, in the strict logical sense.</p></div>

<p>For the true Sage, beyond the limits of an external
world, they exist, but are not recognised. By the
true Sage, within the limits of an external world,
they are recognised, but are not assigned. And so,
with regard to the wisdom of the ancients, as
embodied in the canon of <cite>Spring and Autumn</cite>,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Confucius' history of his native State. Now one of
the canonical books of China.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>the true Sage assigns, but does not justify by argument.
And thus, classifying he does not classify;
arguing, he does not argue."</p>

<p>"How can that be?" asked Tzŭ Yu.</p>

<p>"The true Sage," answered Tzŭ Ch'i, "keeps
his knowledge within him, while men in general set
forth theirs in argument, in order to convince each
other. And therefore it is said that in argument he
does not manifest himself.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Others try to establish their own subjective view.
The true Sage remains passive, aiming only at the
annihilation of contraries.</p></div>

<p>"Perfect <span class="smcap">Tao</span> does not declare itself. Nor does
perfect argument express itself in words. Nor does
perfect charity show itself in act. Nor is perfect
honesty absolutely incorruptible. Nor is perfect
courage absolutely unyielding.</p>

<p>"For the <span class="smcap">Tao</span> which shines forth is not <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.
Speech which argues falls short of its aim. Charity
which has fixed points loses its scope. Honesty
which is absolute is wanting in credit. Courage
which is absolute misses its object. These five are,
as it were, round, with a strong bias towards
squareness. Therefore that knowledge which stops
at what it does not know, is the highest knowledge.</p>

<p>"Who knows the argument which can be argued
without words?&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Tao</span> which does not declare
itself as <span class="smcap">Tao</span>? He who knows this may be said to
be of <span class="smcap">God</span>. To be able to pour in without making
full, and pour out without making empty, in igno<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>rance
of the power by which such results are
accomplished,&mdash;this is accounted <em>Light</em>."</p>

<p>Of old, the Emperor Yao said to Shun, "I
would smite the Tsungs, and the Kueis, and the
Hsü-aos. Ever since I have been on the throne I
have had this desire. What do you think?"</p>

<p>"These three States," replied Shun, "are paltry
out-of-the-way places. Why can you not shake off
this desire? Once upon a time, ten suns came out
together, and all things were illuminated thereby.
How much more then should virtue excel suns?"</p>

<p>Yeh Ch'üeh asked Wang I,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A disciple and tutor of remote antiquity. Said to
have been two of the four Sages on the Miao-ku-shê
mountain mentioned in <a href="#Page_1">ch. i</a>.</p></div>

<p>saying, "Do you know for certain that all things
are subjectively the same?"</p>

<p>"How can I know?" answered Wang I. "Do
you know what you do not know?"</p>

<p>"How can I know?" replied Yeh Ch'üeh. "But
can then nothing be known?"</p>

<p>"How can I know?" said Wang I. "Nevertheless,
I will try to tell you. How can it be
known that what I call knowing is not really not
knowing, and that what I call not knowing is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
really knowing? Now I would ask you this. If
a man sleeps in a damp place, he gets lumbago and
dies. But how about an eel? And living up in a
tree is precarious and trying to the nerves;&mdash;but
how about monkeys? Of the man, the eel, and
the monkey, whose habitat is the right one, absolutely?
Human beings feed on flesh, deer on
grass, centipedes on snakes, owls and crows on
mice. Of these four, whose is the right taste,
absolutely? Monkey mates with monkey, the
buck with the doe; eels consort with fishes, while
men admire Mao Ch'iang and Li Chi,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

The commentators do not seem to have
noted the very obvious anachronism here involved.</p></div>

the water, birds soar high in the air, and deer
hurry away.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For shame at their own inferiority.</p></div>

<p>Yet who shall say which is the correct standard of
beauty? In my opinion, the standard of human
virtue, and of positive and negative, is so obscured
that it is impossible to actually know it
as such."</p>

<p>"If you then," asked Yeh Ch'üeh, "do not know
what is bad for you, is the Perfect Man equally
without this knowledge?"</p>

<p>"The Perfect Man," answered Wang I, "is a
spiritual being. Were the ocean itself scorched
up, he would not feel hot. Were the Milky Way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
frozen hard, he would not feel cold. Were the
mountains to be riven with thunder, and the great
deep to be thrown up by storm, he would not
tremble. In such case, he would mount upon the
clouds of heaven, and driving the sun and the
moon before him, would pass beyond the limits of
this external world, where death and life have no
more victory over man;&mdash;how much less what is

<p>Chü Ch'iao addressed Chang Wu Tzŭ</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A disciple and tutor of antiquity.</p></div>

<p>as follows:&mdash;"I heard Confucius say, 'The true
sage pays no heed to mundane affairs. He neither
seeks gain nor avoids injury. He asks nothing at
the hands of man. He adheres, without questioning,
to <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. Without speaking, he can speak;
and he can speak and yet say nothing. And so
he roams beyond the limits of this dusty world.
These,' added Confucius, 'are wild words.'</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Han Fei Tzŭ tells us that Lao Tzŭ, whose doctrines
Confucius seems to be here deriding, said exactly
the opposite of this; viz: "The true Sage is beforehand
in his attention to mundane affairs," <i>i.e.</i> "takes
time by the forelock." Neither utterance, however,
appears in the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>. See <cite>The Remains
of Lao Tzŭ</cite>, p. 44.</p></div>

<p>Now to me they are the skilful embodiment of

<p>"Points upon which the Yellow Emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
doubted," replied Chang Wu Tzŭ, "how should
Confucius know?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lao Tzŭ and the Yellow Emperor have always
been mixed up in the heads of Taoist writers, albeit
separated by a chasm of some two thousand years.
Confucius is here evidently dealing with the actual
doctrines of Lao Tzŭ.</p></div>

<p>You are going too fast. You see your egg,
and expect to hear it crow. You look at your
cross-bow, and expect to have broiled duck before
you. I will say a few words to you at random, and
do you listen at random.</p>

<p>"How does the Sage seat himself by the sun
and moon, and hold the universe in his grasp?
He blends everything into one harmonious whole,
rejecting the confusion of this and that. Rank
and precedence, which the vulgar prize, the Sage
stolidly ignores. The revolutions of ten thousand
years leave his Unity unscathed. The universe
itself may pass away, but he will flourish still.</p>

<p>"How do I know that love of life is not a
delusion after all? How do I know but that he

the way and cannot find his home?</p>

tears. But when she came to the royal residence,
and lived with the Duke, and ate rich food, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>

<p>"Those who dream of the banquet, wake to
lamentation and sorrow. Those who dream of
lamentation and sorrow wake to join the hunt.
While they dream, they do not know that they
dream. Some will even interpret the very dream
they are dreaming; and only when they awake do
they know it was a dream. By and by comes the
Great Awakening, and then we find out that this
life is really a great dream. Fools think they are
awake now, and flatter themselves they know if
they are really princes or peasants. Confucius and
you are both dreams; and I who say you are
dreams,&mdash;I am but a dream myself. This is a
paradox. Tomorrow a sage may arise to explain
it; but that tomorrow will not be until ten
thousand generations have gone by.</p>

<p>"Granting that you and I argue. If you beat
me, and not I you, are you necessarily right and I
wrong? Or if I beat you and not you me, am I
necessarily right and you wrong? Or are we both
partly right and partly wrong? Or are we both
wholly right and wholly wrong? You and I cannot
know this, and consequently the world will be in
ignorance of the truth.</p>

<p>"Who shall I employ as arbiter between us? If
I employ some one who takes your view, he will
side with you. How can such a one arbitrate
between us? If I employ some one who takes my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
view, he will side with me. How can such a one
arbitrate between us? And if I employ some one
who either differs from, or agrees with, both of us,
he will be equally unable to decide between us.
Since then you, and I, and man, cannot decide,
must we not depend upon Another?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Upon God, in whose infinity all contraries blend
indistinguishably into <span class="smcap">One</span>.</p></div>

<p>Such dependence is as though it were not dependence.
We are embraced in the obliterating unity of
God. There is perfect adaptation to whatever may
eventuate; and so we complete our allotted span.</p>

<p>"But what is it to be embraced in the obliterating
unity of God? It is this. With reference to
positive and negative, to that which is so and that
which is not so,&mdash;if the positive is really positive,
it must necessarily be different from its negative:
there is no room for argument. And if that which
is so really is so, it must necessarily be different
from that which is not so: there is no room for
argument.</p>

<p>"Take no heed of time, nor of right and wrong.

<p>Our refuge is in God alone, the Infinite Absolute.
Contraries cannot but exist, but they should
exist independently of each other without antagonism.
Such a condition is found only in the all-embracing
unity of God, wherein all distinctions of positive and
negative, of right and wrong, of this and of that, are
obliterated and merged in <span class="smcap">One</span>.</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer says, "The antithesis of subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>

<p>Once upon a time, I, Chuang Tzŭ, dreamt I was

only of following my fancies as a butterfly, and
was unconscious of my individuality as a man.
Suddenly, I awaked, and there I lay, myself again.
Now I do not know whether I was then a man
dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a
butterfly dreaming I am a man. Between a man
and a butterfly there is necessarily a barrier. The

<p>Prince Hui's cook was cutting up a bullock.
Every blow of his hand, every heave of his

of his knee, every <em>whshh</em> of rent flesh, every
<em>chhk</em> of the chopper, was in perfect harmony,&mdash;rhythmical

Grove, simultaneous like the chords of the Ching
Shou.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well done!" cried the Prince. "Yours is
skill indeed."</p>

<p>"Sire," replied the cook; "I have always devoted
myself to <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. It is better than skill. When
I first began to cut up bullocks, I saw before me
simply <em>whole</em> bullocks. After three years' practice,
I saw no more whole animals.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Meaning that he saw them, so to speak, in sections.</p></div>

<p>And now I work with my mind and not with my
eye. When my senses bid me stop, but my mind
urges me on, I fall back upon eternal principles.
I follow such openings or cavities as there may
be, according to the natural constitution of the
animal. I do not attempt to cut through joints:
still less through large bones.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For a curious parallelism, see Plato's <cite>Phædrus</cite>, 265.</p></div>

<p>"A good cook changes his chopper once a year,&mdash;because
he cuts. An ordinary cook, once a
month,&mdash;because he hacks. But I have had this
chopper nineteen years, and although I have cut
up many thousand bullocks, its edge is as if fresh
from the whetstone. For at the joints there are
always interstices, and the edge of a chopper
being without thickness, it remains only to insert
that which is without thickness into such an
interstice.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These words help to elucidate a much-vexed passage

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>By these means the interstice will be enlarged,
and the blade will find plenty of room. It is thus
that I have kept my chopper for nineteen years as
though fresh from the whetstone.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, when I come upon a hard part
where the blade meets with a difficulty, I am all
caution. I fix my eye on it. I stay my hand, and
gently apply my blade, until with a <em>hwah</em> the part
yields like earth crumbling to the ground. Then I
take out my chopper, and stand up, and look
around, and pause, until with an air of triumph I
wipe my chopper and put it carefully away."</p>

that man? How came he to lose a foot? Is this
the work of God, or of man?</p>

<p>"Why, of course," continued Hsien, "it is the
work of God, and not of man. When God brought
this man into the world, he wanted him to be
unlike other men. Men always have two feet.
From this it is clear that God and not man made
him as he is.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When Lao Tzŭ died, Ch'in Shih went to mourn.
He uttered three yells and departed.</p>

<p>A disciple asked him saying, "Were you not our
Master's friend?"</p>

<p>"I was," replied Ch'in Shih.</p>

<p>"And if so, do you consider that a sufficient expression
of grief at his loss?" added the disciple.</p>

<p>"I do," said Ch'in Shih. "I had believed him
to be the man of all men, but now I know that he
was not. When I went in to mourn, I found old
persons weeping as if for their children, young ones
wailing as if for their mothers. And for him to
have gained the attachment of those people in this
way, he too must have uttered words which should
not have been spoken, and dropped tears which
should not have been shed, thus violating eternal
principles, increasing the sum of human emotion,
and forgetting the source from which his own life
was received. The ancients called such emotions
the trammels of mortality. The Master came,
because it was his time to be born; he went, because
it was his time to die. For those who accept the
phenomenon of birth and death in this sense,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
lamentation and sorrow have no place. The
ancients spoke of death as of God cutting down a
man suspended in the air. The fuel is consumed,
but the fire may be transmitted, and we know not
that it comes to an end."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I hear," answered Yen Hui, "that the Prince
of Wei is of mature age, but of an unmanageable
disposition. He behaves as if the State were of no
account, and will not see his own faults. Consequently,
the people perish; and their corpses lie
about like so much undergrowth in a marsh. They
are at extremities. And I have heard you, Sir,
say that if a State is well governed it may be
neglected; but that if it is badly governed, then we
should visit it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the <cite>Lun Yü</cite>, Confucius says exactly the opposite
of this.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The science of medicine embraces many various
diseases. I would test my knowledge in this
sense, that perchance I may do some good to that
State."</p>

<p>"Alas!" cried Confucius, "you will only
succeed in bringing evil upon yourself. For <span class="smcap">Tao</span>
must not be distributed. If it is, it will lose its
unity. If it loses its unity, it will be uncertain;
and so cause mental disturbance,&mdash;from which
there is no escape.</p>

<p>"The sages of old first got <span class="smcap">Tao</span> for themselves,
and then got it for others. Before you possess this
yourself, what leisure have you to attend to the
doings of wicked men? Besides, do you know
what Virtue results in and where Wisdom ends?
Virtue results in a desire for fame; Wisdom ends
in contentions. In the struggle for fame men crush
each other, while their wisdom but provokes rivalry.
Both are baleful instruments, and may not be
incautiously used.</p>

<p>"Besides, those who, before influencing by their
own solid virtue and unimpeachable sincerity, and
before reaching the heart by the example of their
own disregard for name and fame, go and preach
charity and duty to one's neighbour to wicked
men,&mdash;only make these men hate them for their
very goodness' sake. Such persons are called <em>evil
speakers</em>. And those who speak evil of others are
apt to be evil spoken of themselves. That, alas!
will be your end.</p>

<p>"On the other hand, if the Prince loves the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and hates the bad, what object will you have in
inviting him to change his ways? Before you have
opened your mouth to preach, the Prince himself
will have seized the opportunity to wrest the victory
from you. Your eye will fall, your expression fade,
your words will stick, your face will change, and
your heart will die within you. It will be as
though you took fire to quell fire, water to quell
water, which is popularly known as 'pouring oil on
the flames.' And if you begin with concessions,
there will be no end to them. Neglect this sound
advice, and you will be the victim of that violent
man.</p>

<p>"Of old, Chieh murdered Kuan Lung Fêng, and
Chou slew Prince Pi Kan. Their victims were both
men who cultivated virtue themselves in order to
secure the welfare of the people. But in doing
this they offended their superiors; and therefore,
because of that very moral culture, their superiors
got rid of them, in order to guard their own
reputations.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Chieh and Chou are the two typical tyrants of
Chinese history.</p></div>

<p>"Of old, Yao attacked the Ts'ung-chih and
Hsü-ao countries, and Yü attacked the Yu-hu
country. Homes were desolated and families destroyed
by the slaughter of the inhabitants. Yet
they fought without ceasing, and strove for victory
to the last. These are instances known to all.
Now if the Sages of old failed in their efforts
against this love of fame, this desire for victory,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>are
you likely to succeed? But of course you have
a scheme. Tell it to me."</p>

<p>"Gravity of demeanour," replied Yen Hui, "and
dispassionateness; energy and singleness of purpose,&mdash;will
this do?"</p>

<p>"Alas!" said Confucius, "that will not do. If you
make a show of being perfect and obtrude yourself,
the Prince's mood will be doubtful. Ordinarily, he
is not opposed, and so he has come to take actual
pleasure in trampling upon the feelings of others.
And if he has thus failed in the practice of routine
virtues, do you expect that he will take readily
to higher ones? You may insist, but without
result. Outwardly you will be right, but inwardly
wrong. How then will you make him
mend his ways?"</p>

<p>"Just so," replied Yen Hui. "I am inwardly
straight, and outwardly crooked, completed after
the models of antiquity.</p>

<p>"He who is inwardly straight is a servant of God.
And he who is a servant of God knows that the Son
of Heaven</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Emperor.</p></div>

<p>and himself are equally the children of God. Shall
then such a one trouble whether man visits him
with evil or with good? Man indeed regards him
as a child; and this is to be a servant of God.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) Children are everywhere exempt.&mdash;This is the
first limb of a threefold argument.</p></div>

<p>"He who is outwardly crooked is a servant of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
man. He bows, he kneels, he folds his hands;&mdash;such
is the ceremonial of a minister. What all
men do, shall I dare not to do? What all men do,
none will blame me for doing. This is to be a
servant of man.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(2) The individual is not punished for the faults of
the community.</p></div>

<p>"He who is completed after the models of
antiquity is a servant of the Sages of old.
Although I utter the words of warning and take
him to task, it is the Sages of old who speak, and
not I. Thus my uprightness will not bring me
into trouble, the servant of the Sages of old.&mdash;Will
this do?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(3) The responsibility rests, not with the mouthpiece,
but with the authors of the doctrines
enunciated.</p></div>

<p>"Alas!" replied Confucius, "No. Your plans
are too many, and are lacking in prudence. However,
your firmness will secure you from harm; but
that is all. You will not influence him to such an
extent that he shall seem to follow the dictates of
his own heart."</p>

<p>"Then," said Yen Hui, "I am without resource,
and venture to ask for a method."</p>

<p>Confucius said, "<em>FAST</em>.... Let me explain.
You have a method, but it is difficult to practise.
Those which are easy are not from God."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Yen Hui, "my family is poor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and for many months we have tasted neither wine
nor flesh. Is not that fasting?"</p>

<p>"The fasting of religious observance it is,"
answered Confucius, "but not the fasting of the
heart."</p>

<p>"And may I ask," said Yen Hui, "in what consists
the fasting of the heart?"</p>

<p>"Cultivate unity," replied Confucius.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Make of the mind as it were an undivided indivisible
<span class="smcap">ONE</span>.</p></div>

<p>"You hear not with the ears, but with the mind;
not with the mind, but with your soul.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The vital fluid which informs your whole being;
in fact, "with your whole self."</p></div>

<p>But let hearing stop with the ears. Let the working
of the mind stop with itself. Then the soul
will be a negative existence, passively responsive
to externals. In such a negative existence, only
<span class="smcap">Tao</span> can abide. And that negative state is the
fasting of the heart."</p>

<p>"Then," said Yen Hui, "the reason I could not
get the use of this method is my own individuality.
If I could get the use of it, my individuality would
have gone. Is this what you mean by the negative
state?"</p>

<p>"Exactly so," replied the Master. "Let me tell
you. If you can enter this man's domain without
offending his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amour propre</i>, cheerful if he hears
you, passive if he does not; without science, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>out
drugs, simply living there in a state of complete
indifference,&mdash;you will be near success. It is
easy to stop walking: the trouble is to walk without
touching the ground. As an agent of man, it
is easy to deceive; but not as an agent of God.
You have heard of winged creatures flying. You
have never heard of flying without wings. You
have heard of men being wise with wisdom. You
have never heard of men wise without wisdom.</p>

<p>"Look at that window. Through it an empty
room becomes bright with scenery; but the landscape
stops outside. Were this not so, we should
have an exemplification of sitting still and running
away at one and the same time.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An empty room would contain something,&mdash;a paradox
like that in the text.</p></div>

<p>"In this sense, you may use your ears and eyes
to communicate within, but shut out all wisdom
from the mind.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Let the channels of your senses be to your mind

<p>It was the instrument which Yü and Shun employed.
It was the secret of the success of Fu

<p>A district of the Ch'u State.</p></div>

<p>being about to go on a mission to the Ch'i State,
asked Confucius, saying, "The mission my
sovereign is sending me on is a most important
one. Of course, I shall be received with all due
respect, but they will not take the same interest in
the matter that I shall. And as an ordinary person
cannot be pushed, still less a Prince, I am in a
state of great alarm.</p>

<p>"Now you, Sir, have told me that in all undertakings
great and small, <span class="smcap">Tao</span> alone leads to a
happy issue. Otherwise that, failing success, there
is to be feared punishment from without, and with
success, punishment from within; while exemption
in case either of success or non-success falls only
to the share of those who possess the virtue
required.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>I.e.</i> those to whom the issue, as regards their own
reward or punishment, is a matter of the completest
indifference.</p>

<p>The term <em>virtue</em>, here as elsewhere unless specially
notified, should be understood in the sense of exemplification
of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I am not dainty with my food; neither
am I always wanting to cool myself when hot.
However, this morning I received my orders, and
this evening I have been drinking iced water. I
am so hot inside. Before I have put my hand to
the business I am suffering punishment from
within; and if I do not succeed I am sure to suffer
punishment from without. Thus I get both
punishments, which is really more than I can bear.
Kindly tell me what there is to be done."</p>

<p>"There exist two sources of safety," Confucius
replied. "One is <em>Destiny</em>: the other is <em>Duty</em>. A
child's love for its parents is destiny. It is inseparable
from the child's life. A subject's allegiance
to his sovereign is duty. Beneath the canopy of
heaven there is no place to which he can escape from
it. These two sources of safety may be explained
as follows. To serve one's parents without reference
to <em>place</em> but only to the service, is the acme of
filial piety. To serve one's prince without reference
to the <em>act</em> but only to the service, is the perfection
of a subject's loyalty. To serve one's own heart
so as to permit neither joy nor sorrow within, but
to cultivate resignation to the inevitable,&mdash;this is
the climax of Virtue.</p>

<p>"Now a minister often finds himself in circumstances
over which he has no control. But if
he simply confines himself to his work, and is
utterly oblivious of self, what leisure has he for
loving life or hating death? And so you may
safely go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I have yet more to tell you. All intercourse,
if personal, should be characterised by
sincerity. If from a distance, it should be carried
on in loyal terms. These terms will have to be
transmitted by some one. Now the transmission
of messages of good- or ill-will is the hardest thing
possible. Messages of good-will are sure to be
overdone with fine phrases; messages of ill-will
with harsh ones. In each case the result is
exaggeration, and a consequent failure to carry
conviction, for which the envoy suffers. Therefore
it was said in the <cite>Fa-yen</cite>,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Name of an ancient book.</p></div>

<p>'Confine yourself to simple statements of fact,
shorn of all superfluous expression of feeling, and
your risk will be small.'</p>

<p>"In trials of skill, at first all is friendliness; but
at last it is all antagonism. Skill is pushed too far.
So on festive occasions, the drinking which is in
the beginning orderly enough, degenerates into riot
and disorder. Festivity is pushed too far. It is
in fact the same with all things: they begin with
good faith and end with contempt. From small
beginnings come great endings.</p>

<p>"Speech is like wind to wave. Action is liable
to divergence from its true goal. By wind, waves
are easily excited. Divergence from the true goal
is fraught with danger. Thus angry feelings rise
up without a cause. Specious words and dishonest
arguments follow, as the wild random cries of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
animal at the point of death. Both sides give way
to passion. For where one party drives the other
too much into a corner, resistance will always be
provoked without apparent cause. And if the
cause is not apparent, how much less will the
ultimate effect be so?</p>

<p>"Therefore it is said in the <cite>Fa-yen</cite>, 'Neither
deviate from nor travel beyond your instructions.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Travel beyond your instructions," is literally,
"urge a settlement."</p></div>

<p>To pass the limit is to go to excess.'</p>

<p>"To deviate from, or to travel beyond instructions,
may imperil the negotiation. A settlement
to be successful must be lasting. It is too late to
change an evil settlement once made.</p>

<p>"Therefore let yourself be carried along without
fear, taking refuge in <em>no alternative</em> to preserve
you from harm on either side. This is the utmost
you can do. What need for considering your
obligations? Better leave all to Destiny, difficult
as this may be."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is passing strange that this exposition of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez-aller</i> inaction doctrine of <span class="smcap">Tao</span> should be placed
in the mouth of Confucius, who is thus made in some
measure to discredit his own teachings. The commentators,
however, see nothing anomalous in the
position here assigned to the Sage.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A philosopher from the Lu State.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>was about to become tutor to the eldest son of
Prince Ling of the Wei State. Accordingly he
observed to Chü Poh Yü,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Prime Minister of the Wei State.</p></div>

<p>"Here is a man whose disposition is naturally
of a low order. To let him take his own unprincipled
way is to endanger the State. To try to
restrain him is to endanger one's personal safety.
He has just wit enough to see faults in others, but
not to see his own. I am consequently at a loss
what to do."</p>

<p>"A good question indeed," replied Chü Poh Yü,
"You must be careful, and begin by self-reformation.
Outwardly you may adapt yourself, but
inwardly you must keep up to your own standard.
In this there are two points to be guarded against.
You must not let the outward adaptation penetrate
within, nor the inward standard manifest itself
without. In the former case, you will fall, you
will be obliterated, you will collapse, you will lie
prostrate. In the latter case, you will be a sound,
a name, a bogie, an uncanny thing. If he would
play the child, do you play the child too. If he
cast aside all sense of decorum, do you do so too.
As far as he goes, do you go also. Thus you will
reach him without offending him.</p>

<p>"Don't you know the story of the praying mantis?
In its rage it stretched out its arms to prevent a
chariot from passing, unaware that this was beyond
its strength, so admirable was its energy!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Be cautious. If you are always offending others
by your superiority, you will probably come to
grief.</p>

<p>"Do you not know that those who keep tigers
do not venture to give them live animals as food,
for fear of exciting their fury when killing the
prey? Also, that whole animals are not given,
for fear of exciting the tigers' fury when rending
them? The periods of hunger and repletion are
carefully watched in order to prevent such outbursts.
The tiger is of a different species from
man; but the latter too is manageable if properly
managed, unmanageable if excited to fury.</p>

<p>"Those who are fond of horses surround them
with various conveniences. Sometimes mosquitoes
or flies trouble them; and then, unexpectedly to
the animal, a groom will brush them off, the result
being that the horse breaks his bridle, and hurts
his head and chest. The intention is good, but
there is a want of real care for the horse. Against
this you must be on your guard."</p>

<p>A certain artisan was travelling to the Ch'i State.
On reaching Ch'ü-yüan, he saw a sacred <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i> tree,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A worthless species of oak.</p></div>

<p>large enough to hide an ox behind it, a hundred
spans in girth, towering up ten cubits over the
hill top, and carrying behind it branches, many
tens of the smallest of which were of a size
for boats. Crowds stood gazing at it, but our
artisan took no notice, and went on his way with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>out
even casting a look behind. His apprentice
however gazed his fill, and when he caught up
his master, said, "Ever since I have handled an
adze in your service, I have never seen such a
splendid piece of timber as that. How was
it that you, sir, did not care to stop and look
at it?"</p>

<p>"It's not worth talking about," replied his
master. "It's good for nothing. Make a boat of
it,&mdash;'twould sink. A coffin,&mdash;'twould rot. Furniture,&mdash;'twould
soon break down. A door,&mdash;'twould
sweat. A pillar,&mdash;'twould be worm-eaten. It is
wood of no quality, and of no use. That is why
it has attained its present age."</p>

<p>When the artisan reached home, he dreamt that
the tree appeared to him in a dream and spoke
as follows:&mdash;"What is it that you compare me
with? Is it with the more elegant trees?&mdash;The
cherry-apple, the pear, the orange, the pumelo,
and other fruit-bearers, as soon as their fruit
ripens are stripped and treated with indignity.
The great boughs are snapped off, the small ones
scattered abroad. Thus do these trees by their
own value injure their own lives. They cannot
fulfil their allotted span of years, but perish prematurely
in mid-career from their entanglement
with the world around them. Thus it is with
all things. For a long period my aim was to
be useless. Many times I was in danger, but
at length I succeeded, and so became useful as
I am to-day. But had I then been of use, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
should not now be of the great use I am. Moreover,
you and I belong both to the same category
of things. Have done then with this criticism of
others. Is a good-for-nothing fellow whose dangers
are not yet passed a fit person to talk of a good-for-nothing
tree?"</p>

<p>When our artisan awaked and told his dream,
his apprentice said, "If the tree aimed at uselessness,
how was it that it became a sacred tree?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Which of course may be said to be of use.</p></div>

<p>"What you don't understand," replied his
master, "don't talk about. That was merely to
escape from the attacks of its enemies. Had it
not become sacred, how many would have wanted to
cut it down! The means of safety adopted were
different from ordinary means,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In order to reach the somewhat extraordinary goal
of uselessness.</p></div>

a large tree which astonished him very much. A
thousand chariot teams could have found shelter
under its shade.</p>

<p>"What tree is this?" cried Tzŭ Ch'i. "Surely it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
must have unusually fine timber." Then looking
up, he saw that its branches were too crooked for
rafters; while as to the trunk he saw that its
irregular grain made it valueless for coffins. He
tasted a leaf, but it took the skin off his lips; and
its odour was so strong that it would make a man
as it were drunk for three days together.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Tzŭ Ch'i. "This tree is good for
nothing, and that is how it has attained this size.

<p>In the State of Sung there is a place called
Ching-shih, where thrive the beech, the cedar, and
the mulberry. Such as are of a one-handed span

Those of two or three two-handed spans are cut
down for the beams of fine houses. Those of seven
or eight such spans are cut down for the solid sides
of rich men's coffins.</p>

the misfortune which overtakes worth.</p>

<p>For the sacrifices to the River God, neither bulls

This had been revealed to the soothsayers, and these

his head. His hair knot looked up to the sky.
His viscera were upside down. His buttocks were

washing, he was easily able to earn his living. By
sifting rice he could make enough to support a
family of ten.</p>

stoop.</p></div>

<p>When orders came down for a conscription, the
hunchback stood unconcerned among the crowd.

deformity shielded him from being employed.</p>

yet none estimate them at their true value. The
misfortunes of this life are weighty as the earth
itself, yet none can keep out of their reach. No
more, no more, seek to influence by virtue. Beware,
beware, move cautiously on! O ferns, O ferns,
wound not my steps! Through my tortuous
journey wound not my feet! Hills suffer from the
trees they produce. Fat burns by its own combustibility.
Cinnamon trees furnish food: therefore
they are cut down. The lacquer tree is felled
for use. All men know the use of useful things;
but they do not know the use of useless things."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">The Evidence of Virtue Complete.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Argument</i>:&mdash;Correspondence between inward virtue and outward influence&mdash;The
virtuous man disregards externals&mdash;The possession of virtue
causes oblivion of outward form&mdash;Neglect of the human&mdash;Cultivation
of the divine.</p></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> the State of Lu there was a man, named
Wang T'ai, who had had his toes cut off. His
disciples were as numerous as those of Confucius.</p>

<p>Ch'ang Chi</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One of the latter.</p></div>

<p>asked Confucius, saying, "This Wang T'ai has
been mutilated, yet he divides with you, Sir, the
teaching of the Lu State. He neither preaches nor
discusses; yet those who go to him empty, depart
full. He must teach <em>the doctrine which does not
find expression in words</em>;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The doctrine of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. These words occur in chs. ii
and xliii of the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>. See <cite>The Remains
of Lao Tzŭ</cite>, p. 7.</p></div>

<p>and although his shape is imperfect, his mind is
perhaps complete. What manner of man is
this?"</p>

<p>"He is a prophet," replied Confucius, "whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
instruction I have been late in seeking. I will
go and learn from him. And if I,&mdash;why not
those who are not equal to me? And I will take
with me, not the State of Lu only, but the whole
world."</p>

<p>"The fellow has been mutilated," said Ch'ang
Chi, "and yet people call him <em>Master</em>. He must
be very different from the ordinary run. But how
does he use his mind in this sense?"</p>

<p>"Life and Death are all powerful," answered
Confucius, "but they cannot affect <em>it</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The mind, or soul, which is immortal. See <a href="#Page_33">ch. iii</a>.</p></div>

<p>Heaven and earth may collapse, but <em>that</em> will
remain. If <em>this</em> is found to be without flaw, it will
not share the fate of all things. It can cause other
things to change, while preserving its own constitution
intact."</p>

<p>"How so?" asked Ch'ang Chi.</p>

<p>"From the point of view of difference," replied
Confucius, "we distinguish between the liver and
the gall, between the Ch'u State and the Yüeh
State. From the point of view of sameness, all
things are <span class="smcap">ONE</span>. Such is the position of Wang
T'ai. He does not trouble about what reaches him
through the senses of hearing and sight, but directs
his whole mind towards the very climax of virtue.
He beholds all things as though <span class="smcap">ONE</span>, without
observing their discrepancies. And thus the discrepancy
of his toes is to him as would be the loss
of so much mud."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"He devotes himself in fact to himself," said
Ch'ang Chi, "and uses his wisdom to perfect his
mind, until it becomes perfect. But how then is it
that people make so much of him?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His virtue being wholly, as it were, of a selfish
order.</p></div>

<p>"A man," replied Confucius, "does not seek to
see himself in running water, but in still water.
For only what is itself still can instil stillness into
others.</p>

<p>"The grace of earth has reached only to pines
and cedars;&mdash;winter and summer alike they are
green. The grace of God has reached to Yao and
to Shun alone;&mdash;the first and foremost of all creation.
Happily they were able to regulate their own
lives and thus regulate the lives of all mankind.</p>

<p>"By nourishment of physical courage, the sense
of fear may be so eliminated that a man will, single-handed,
brave a whole army. And if such a result
can be achieved in search of fame, how much more
by one who extends his sway over heaven and
earth and influences all things; and who, lodging
within the confines of a body with its channels of
sight and sound, brings his knowledge to know
that all things are <span class="smcap">ONE</span>, and that his soul endures
for ever! Besides, he awaits his appointed hour,
and men flock to him of their own accord. He
makes no effort to attract them."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That men thus gather around him is the outward
sign or evidence of his inward virtue complete.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Shên T'u Chia had had his toes cut off. Subsequently,
he studied under Poh Hun Wu Jen at
the same time as Tzŭ Ch'an of the Chêng State.
The latter said to him, "When I leave first, do
you remain awhile. When you leave first, I will
remain behind."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Tzŭ Ch'an was a model minister of the sixth century
B.C. Under his guidance the people of the Chêng
State became so virtuous that doors were not locked
at night, nor would any one pick up lost articles left
lying in the road. He was hardly likely to be
ashamed of walking out with a mutilated criminal.</p></div>

<p>Next day, when they were again together in the
lecture-room, Tzŭ Ch'an said, "When I leave first,
do you remain awhile. When you leave first, I
will remain. I am now about to go. Will you
remain or not? I notice you show no respect to a
Minister of State. Perhaps you think yourself my
equal?"</p>

<p>"Dear me!" replied Shên T'u Chia, "I didn't
know we had a Minister of State in the class.
Perhaps you think that because you are one you
should take precedence over the rest. Now I have
heard that if a mirror is perfectly bright, dust and
dirt will not collect on it. That if they do, it is
because the mirror was not bright. He who
associates for long with the wise will be without
fault. Now you have been improving yourself at
the feet of our Master, yet you can utter words like
these. Is not the fault in you?"</p>

<p>"You are a fine fellow, certainly," retorted Tz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>ŭ
Ch'an, "you will be emulating the virtue of Yao
next. To look at you, I should say you had
enough to do to attend to your own shortcomings!"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A sneer at his want of toes.</p></div>

<p>"Those who disguise their faults," said Shên
T'u Chia, "so as not to lose their toes, are many
in number. Those who do not disguise their faults,
and so fail to keep them, are few. To recognise
the inevitable and to quietly acquiesce in Destiny,
is the achievement of the virtuous man alone. He
who should put himself in front of the bull's-eye
when Hou I</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A Chinese Tell.</p></div>

<p>was shooting, would be hit. If he was not hit, it
would be destiny. Those with toes who laugh at
me for having no toes are many. This used to
make me angry. But since I have studied under
our Master, I have ceased to trouble about it. It
may be that our Master has so far succeeded in
purifying me. At any rate I have been with him
nineteen years without being aware of the loss of
my toes. Now you and I are engaged in studying
the internal. Do you not then commit a fault by
thus dragging me back to the external?"</p>

<p>At this Tzŭ Ch'an began to fidget, and changing
countenance, begged Shên T'u Chia to say no
more.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was a man of the Lu State who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
mutilated,&mdash;Shu Shan <em>No-toes</em>. He came walking
on his heels to see Confucius; but Confucius said,
"You did not take care, and so brought this misfortune
upon yourself. What is the use of coming
to me now?"</p>

<p>"In my ignorance," replied No-toes, "I made
free with my body and lost my toes. But I come
with something more precious than toes which I
now seek to keep. There is no man, but Heaven
covers him: there is no man, but Earth supports
him;&mdash;and I thought that you, sir, would be as
Heaven and Earth. I little expected to hear these
words from you."</p>

<p>"I must apologise," said Confucius. "Pray
walk in and let us discuss." But No-toes walked
out.</p>

<p>"There!" said Confucius to his disciples.
"There is a criminal without toes who seeks to
learn in order to make atonement for his previous
misdeeds. And if he, how much more those who
have no misdeeds for which to atone?"</p>

<p>No-toes went off to Lao Tzŭ and said, "Is
Confucius a sage, or is he not? How is it he has
so many disciples? He aims at being a subtle
dialectician, not knowing that such a reputation is
regarded by real sages as the fetters of a criminal."</p>

<p>"Why do you not meet him with the continuity
of life and death, the identity of <em>can</em> and <em>can not</em>,"
answered Lao Tzŭ, "and so release him from these
fetters?"</p>

<p>"He has been thus punished by God," replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
No-toes. "It would be impossible to release
him."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A sneer at Confucius. No-toes himself had only
been punished by man.</p></div>

<p>Duke Ai of the Lu State said to Confucius, "In
the Wei State there is a leper, named Ai T'ai T'o.
The men who live with him like him and make no
effort to get rid of him. Of the women who have
seen him, many have said to their parents, Rather
than be another man's wife, I would be his
concubine.</p>

<p>"He never preaches at people, but puts himself
into sympathy with them. He wields no
power by which he may protect men's bodies. He
has at his disposal no appointments by which to
gratify their hearts. He is loathsome to a degree.
He sympathises, but does not instruct. His knowledge
is limited to his own State. Yet males and
females alike all congregate around him.</p>

<p>"So thinking that he must be different from
ordinary men, I sent for him, and saw that he was
indeed loathsome to a degree. Yet we had not
been many months together ere my attention was
fixed upon his conduct. A year had not elapsed
ere I trusted him thoroughly; and as my State
wanted a Prime Minister, I offered the post to him.
He accepted it sullenly, as if he would much rather
have declined. Perhaps he didn't think me good
enough for him! At any rate, he took it; but in
a very short time he left me and went away. I
grieved for him as for a lost friend, and as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
there were none left with whom I could rejoice.
What manner of man is this?</p>

<p>"When I was on a mission to the Ch'u State,"
replied Confucius, "I saw a litter of young pigs
sucking their dead mother. After a while they
looked at her, and then they all left the body and
went off. For their mother did not look at them
any more, nor did she any more seem to be of their
kind. What they loved was their mother; not the
body which contained her, but that which made the
body what it was.</p>

<p>"When a man is killed in battle, his arms are
not buried with him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He has no further use for weapons.</p></div>

<p>A man whose toes have been cut off does not
value a present of boots. In each case the function
of such things is gone.</p>

<p>"The concubines of the Son of Heaven do not
cut their nails or pierce their ears.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For fear of injuring their persons.</p></div>

<p>He who has a marriageable daughter keeps her
away from menial work. To preserve her beauty
is quite enough occupation for her. How much
more so for a man of perfect virtue?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Who should trouble himself only about the internal.</p></div>

<p>"Now Ai T'ai T'o says nothing, and is trusted.
He does nothing, and is sought after. He causes
a man to offer him the government of his own
State, and the only fear is lest he should decline.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Truly his talents are perfect and his virtue without
outward form!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by his talents being perfect?"
asked the Duke.</p>

<p>"Life and Death," replied Confucius, "existence
and non-existence, success and non-success,
poverty and wealth, virtue and vice, good and evil
report, hunger and thirst, warmth and cold,&mdash;these
all revolve upon the changing wheel of Destiny.
Day and night they follow one upon the other, and
no man can say where each one begins. Therefore
they cannot be allowed to disturb the harmony
of the organism, nor enter into the soul's domain.
Swim however with the tide, so as not to offend
others. Do this day by day without break, and
live in peace with mankind. Thus you will be
ready for all contingencies, and may be said to have
your talents perfect."</p>

<p>"And virtue without outward form; what is
that?"</p>

<p>"In a water-level," said Confucius, "the water
is in a most perfect state of repose. Let that be
your model. The water remains quietly within,
and does not overflow. It is from the cultivation
of such harmony that virtue results. And if virtue
takes no outward form, man will not be able to
keep aloof from it."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mankind will be regenerated thereby, in the same
way that evenness is imparted by the aid of water
to surfaces, although the water is all the time closed
up and does not overflow.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Some days afterwards Duke Ai told Min Tzŭ,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One of Confucius' disciples.</p></div>

<p>saying, "When first I took the reins of government
in hand, I thought that in caring for my
people's lives I had done all my duty as a ruler.
But now that I have heard what a perfect man is, I
fear that I have not been succeeding, but foolishly
using my body and working destruction to my
State. Confucius and I are not prince and
minister, but merely friends with a care for each
other's moral welfare."</p>

<p>A certain hunchback, named Wu Ch'un, whose
heels did not touch the ground, had the ear of Duke
Ling of Wei. The Duke took a great fancy to
him; and as for well-formed men, he thought
their necks were too short.</p>

<p>Another man, with a goitre as big as a large
jar, had the ear of Duke Huan of Ch'i. The Duke
took a great fancy to him; and as for well-formed
men, he thought their necks were too thin.</p>

<p>Thus it is that virtue should prevail and outward
form be forgotten. But mankind forgets not that
which is to be forgotten, forgetting that which is
not to be forgotten. This is forgetfulness indeed!
And thus with the truly wise, wisdom is a curse,
sincerity like glue, virtue only a means to acquire,
and skill nothing more than a commercial capacity.
For the truly wise make no plans, and therefore
require no wisdom. They do not separate, and
therefore require no glue. They want nothing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
therefore need no virtue. They sell nothing, and
therefore are not in want of a commercial capacity.
These four qualifications are bestowed upon them
by God and serve as heavenly food to them. And
those who thus feed upon the divine have little
need for the human. They wear the forms of men,
without human passions. Because they wear the
forms of men, they associate with men. Because
they have not human passions, positives and negatives
find in them no place. Infinitesimal indeed
is that which makes them man: infinitely great is
that which makes them divine!</p>

<p>Hui Tzŭ said to Chuang Tzŭ, "Are there then
men who have no passions?"</p>

<p>Chuang Tzŭ replied, "Certainly."</p>

<p>"But if a man has no passions," argued Hui
Tzŭ, "what is it that makes him a man?"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Tao</span>," replied Chuang Tzŭ, "gives him his
expression, and God gives him his form. How
should he not be a man?"</p>

<p>"If then he is a man," said Hui Tzŭ, "how can
he be without passions?"</p>

<p>"What you mean by passions," answered Chuang
Tzŭ, "is not what I mean. By a man without
passions I mean one who does not permit good
and evil to disturb his internal economy, but
rather falls in with whatever happens, as a matter
of course, and does not add to the sum of his
mortality."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The play of passion would tend to create conditions
which otherwise would not exist.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"But whence is man to get his body," asked
Hui Tzŭ, "if there is to be no adding to the sum
of mortality?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is of course a gibe. Hui Tzŭ purposely
takes Chuang Tzŭ's words <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à double entente</i>.</p></div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Tao</span> gives him his expression," said Chuang
Tzŭ, "and God gives him his form. He does not
permit good and evil to disturb his internal
economy. But now you are devoting your intelligence
to externals, and wearing out your mental
powers. You prop yourself against a tree and
mutter, or lean over a table with half-closed eyes.</p>

<p>Chang Tzŭ puts his last sentence into doggerel,
the more effectively to turn the tables against Hui
Tzŭ, whose paradoxical theories he is never tired of

<p><i>Argument</i>:&mdash;The human and the divine&mdash;The pure men of old&mdash;Their
qualifications&mdash;Their self-abstraction&mdash;All things as ONE&mdash;The known
and the unknown&mdash;Life a boon&mdash;Death a transition&mdash;Life eternal
open to all&mdash;The way thither&mdash;Illustrations.</p></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">He</span> who knows what God is, and who knows
what Man is, has attained. Knowing what
God is, he knows that he himself proceeded therefrom.
Knowing what Man is, he rests in the
knowledge of the known, waiting for the knowledge
of the unknown. Working out one's allotted
span, and not perishing in mid career,&mdash;this is the
fulness of knowledge.</p>

<p>God is a principle which exists by virtue of its
own intrinsicality, and operates spontaneously,
without self-manifestation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is in the human that the divine finds expression.
Man emanates from God, and should therefore be
on earth, in this brief life of ours, what God is for
all eternity in the universe.</p></div>

<p>Herein, however, there is a flaw. Knowledge is
dependent upon fulfilment. And as this fulfilment
is uncertain, how can it be known that my divine
is not really human, my human really divine?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>We must have <em>pure men</em>, and then only can we
have <em>pure knowledge</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Pure" must be understood in the sense of transcendent.</p></div>

<p>But what is a pure man?&mdash;The pure men of old
acted without calculation, not seeking to secure
results. They laid no plans. Therefore, failing,
they had no cause for regret; succeeding, no cause
for congratulation. And thus they could scale
heights without fear; enter water without becoming
wet; fire, without feeling hot. So far had
their wisdom advanced towards <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The world-spirit is a good swimmer, and storms
and waves cannot drown him."&mdash;<cite>Emerson.</cite></p></div>

<p>The pure men of old slept without dreams, and
waked without anxiety. They ate without discrimination,
breathing deep breaths. For pure
men draw breath from their uttermost depths; the
vulgar only from their throats.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Uttermost depths" is literally "heels," but all the
best commentators take the sentence to mean that
pure men breathe with their whole being, and not as
it were superficially, from the throat only.</p>

<p>This passage is probably responsible for the trick
of taking deep inhalations of morning air, practised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
(not without scientific foundation) by the followers of
the debased Taoism of modern times. Other tricks
for prolonging life, such as swallowing the saliva
three times in every two hours, etc., are more open
to adverse criticism. See the <cite>T'ai-Hsi-Ching</cite>.</p></div>

<p>Out of the crooked, words are retched up like
vomit. If men's passions are deep, their divinity
is shallow.</p>

<p>The pure men of old did not know what it was
to love life or to hate death. They did not rejoice
in birth, nor strive to put off dissolution. Quickly
come, and quickly go;&mdash;no more. They did not
forget whence it was they had sprung, neither did
they seek to hasten their return thither. Cheerfully
they played their allotted parts, waiting patiently
for the end. This is what is called not to lead the
heart astray from <span class="smcap">Tao</span>,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By admitting play of passion in the sense condemned
in <a href="#Page_56">ch. v</a>. which would hinder the mind from
resting quietly in the knowledge of the known.</p></div>

<p>nor to let the human seek to supplement the divine.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But to wait patiently for the knowledge of the
unknown.</p></div>

<p>And this is what is meant by a pure man.</p>

<p>Such men are in mind absolutely free; in demeanour,
grave; in expression, cheerful. If it is
freezing cold, it seems to them like autumn; if
blazing hot, like spring. Their passions occur like
the four seasons.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Each at its appointed time.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>They are in harmony with all creation, and none
know the limit thereof.</p>

<p>These last few words occur in the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>,
ch. lviii. See <cite>The Remains of Lao Tzŭ</cite>, p. 40.
Also, with a variation, in <a href="#Page_276">ch. xxii</a> of this work.</p></div>

<p>And so it is that a perfect man can destroy a kingdom
and yet not lose the hearts of the people,
while the benefits he hands down to ten thousand
generations do not proceed from love of his fellow-man.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whatever he does is spontaneous, and therefore
natural, and therefore in accordance with right.</p></div>

<p>He who delights in man, is himself not a perfect
man. His affection is not true charity.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Charity is the universal love of all creation which
admits of no particular manifestations.</p></div>

<p>Depending upon opportunity, he has not true
worth.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>True worth is independent of circumstances. It
is a quality which is always unconsciously operating
for good, and needs no opportunity to call it into
existence.</p></div>

evil is not a superior man.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The good, to practise; the evil, to avoid.</p></div>

Ch'i, Chi Tzŭ Hsü Yü, Chi T'o, and Shên T'u Ti,
were the servants of rulers, and did the behests of
others, not their own.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A list of ancient worthies whose careers had been
more or less unsuccessful. Of the first and second
little is known, except that the ears of the latter
were seven inches long.</p>

<p>The third and fourth were brothers and are types
of moral purity. Each refused the throne of their
State, because each considered his brother more
entitled thereto. Finally, they died of starvation on
the mountains rather than submit to a change of the
Imperial dynasty. More will be heard of these two
later on.</p>

<p>The fifth smeared his body all over with lacquer,
so that no one should come near him. Of the
sixth, nothing is recorded; and of the seventh, only
that he tied a stone around his neck and jumped
into a river. See the <cite>Fragmenta</cite> at the end of the
works of Shih Tzŭ.</p></div>

<p>The pure men of old did their duty to their
neighbours, but did not associate with them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Among them, but not of them.</p></div>

<p>They behaved as though wanting in themselves,
but without flattering others. Naturally rectangular,
they were not uncompromisingly hard. They
manifested their independence without going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
extremes. They appeared to smile as if pleased,
when the expression was only a natural response.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As required by the exigencies of society.</p></div>

<p>Their outward semblance derived its fascination
from the store of goodness within. They seemed
to be of the world around them, while proudly
treading beyond its limits. They seemed to desire
silence, while in truth they had dispensed with
language.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See <a href="#Page_56">ch. v</a>.</p></div>

<p>They saw in penal laws a trunk;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A natural basis of government.</p></div>

<p>in social ceremonies, wings;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To aid man's progress through life.</p></div>

<p>in wisdom, a useful accessory; in morality, a guide.
For them penal laws meant a merciful administration;
social ceremonies, a passport through the
world; wisdom, an excuse for doing what they
could not help; and morality, walking like others
upon the path.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Instead of at random across country. At such an
early date was uniformity a characteristic of the
Chinese people.</p></div>

<p>And thus all men praised them for the worthy lives
they led.</p>

<p>For what they cared for could be reduced to <span class="smcap">ONE</span>,
and what they did not care for to <span class="smcap">ONE</span> also. That
which was <span class="smcap">ONE</span> was <span class="smcap">ONE</span>, and that which was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">ONE</span> was likewise <span class="smcap">ONE</span>. In that which was <span class="smcap">ONE</span>,
they were of God; in that which was not <span class="smcap">ONE</span>, they
were of Man. And so between the human and the
divine no conflict ensued. This was to be a pure
man.</p>

<p>Life and Death belong to Destiny. Their
sequence, like day and night, is of God, beyond
the interference of man, an inevitable law.</p>

<p>A man looks upon God as upon his father, and
loves him in like measure. Shall he then not love
that which is greater than God?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Sc.</i> <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p></div>

<p>A man looks upon a ruler of men as upon some one
better than himself, for whom he would sacrifice his
life. Shall he not then do so for the Supreme
Ruler of Creation?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Sc.</i> <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, the omnipresent, omnipotent Principle
which invests even God himself with the power and
attributes of divinity.</p>

<p>The careful student of pure Taoism will find however
that the distinction between <span class="smcap">Tao</span> and God is
sometimes so subtle as altogether to elude his
intelligence.</p></div>

<p>When the pond dries up, and the fishes are left
upon dry ground, to moisten them with the breath
or to damp them with spittle is not to be compared
with leaving them in the first instance in their
native rivers and lakes. And better than praising
Yao and blaming Chieh would be leaving them both
and attending to the development of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tao</span> gives me this form, this toil in manhood,
this repose in old age, this rest in death. And surely
that which is such a kind arbiter of my life is the
best arbiter of my death.</p>

<p>A boat may be hidden in a creek, or in a bog, safe
enough.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The text has "or a mountain in a bog," which taken
with the context seems to me to be nonsense. Yet
all the commentators labour to explain away the
difficulty, instead of making the obvious change of
"mountain" into "boat," to which change the forms
of the two Chinese characters readily lend themselves.
In over two thousand years of literary
activity, it seems but rarely to have occurred to the
Chinese that a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">textus receptus</i> could contain a
copyist's slip.</p></div>

<p>But at midnight a strong man may come and carry
away the boat on his back. The dull of vision do
not perceive that however you conceal things, small
ones in larger ones, there will always be a chance of
losing them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The boat is figurative of our mortal coil which cannot
be hidden from decay.</p></div>

<p>But if you conceal the whole universe in the whole
universe, there will be no place left wherein it may
be lost. The laws of matter make this to be so.</p>

<p>To have attained to the human form must be
always a source of joy. And then, to undergo
countless transitions, with only the infinite to look
forward to,&mdash;what incomparable bliss is that!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Therefore it is that the truly wise rejoice in that
which can never be lost, but endures alway.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The soul which as <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, is commensurate only with
time and space.</p></div>

<p>For if we can accept early death, old age, a
beginning, and an end,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As inseparable from Destiny,&mdash;already a step in the
right direction.</p></div>

<p>why not that which informs all creation and is of
all phenomena the Ultimate Cause?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The long chain of proximate causes reaches finality

<p><span class="smcap">Tao</span> has its laws, and its evidences. It is devoid
both of action and of form. It may be transmitted,
but cannot be received.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>So that the receiver can say he has it.</p></div>

<p>It may be obtained, but cannot be seen. Before
heaven and earth were, <span class="smcap">Tao</span> was. It has existed
without change from all time. Spiritual beings
drew their spirituality therefrom, while the universe
became what we can see it now. To <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, the zenith
is not high, nor the nadir low; no point in time is
long ago, nor by lapse of ages has it grown old.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Probably the individual mentioned in chs. <a href="#Page_12">ii</a>. and <a href="#Page_38">iv</a>.</p></div>

<p>said to Nü Yü,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By one authority said to be a woman.</p></div>

<p>"You are old, Sir, and yet your countenance is like
that of a child. How is this?"</p>

<p>Nü Yü replied, "I have learnt <span class="smcap">Tao</span>."</p>

<p>"Could I get <span class="smcap">Tao</span> by studying it?" asked the
other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"I fear not," said Nü Yü. "You are not the
sort of man. There was Pu Liang I. He had all
the qualifications of a sage, but not <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. Now I
had Tao, though none of the qualifications. But
do you imagine that much as I wished it I was able
to teach <span class="smcap">Tao</span> to him so that he should be a perfect
sage? Had it been so, then to teach <span class="smcap">Tao</span> to one
who has the qualifications of a sage would be an
easy matter. No, Sir. I imparted as though withholding;
and in three days, for him, this sublunary
state had ceased to exist.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>With all its paltry distinctions of sovereign and
subject, high and low, good and bad, etc.</p></div>

<p>When he had attained to this, I withheld again;
and in seven days more, for him, the external world
had ceased to be. And so again for another nine
days, when he became unconscious of his own
existence. He became first etherealised, next possessed
of perfect wisdom, then without past or
present, and finally able to enter there where life
and death are no more,&mdash;where killing does not
take away life, nor does prolongation of life add
to the duration of existence.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In <span class="smcap">Tao</span> life and death are <span class="smcap">One</span>.</p></div>

<p>In that state, he is ever in accord with the exigencies
of his environment;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Literally, there is no sense in which he is not
accompanying or meeting, destroying or constructing.
That is, in spite of his spiritual condition as
above described, he can still adapt himself naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to life among his fellow-men. The retirement of a
hermit is by no means necessary to the perfection
of the pure man.</p></div>

<p>and this is to be <em>Battered but not Bruised</em>. And
he who can be thus battered but not bruised is on
the way to perfection."</p>

<p>"And how did you manage to get hold of all
this?" asked Nan Po Tzŭ K'uei.</p>

<p>"I got it from books," replied Nü Yü; "and
the books got it from learning, and learning from
investigation, and investigation from cö-ordination,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of eye and mind.</p></div>

<p>and cö-ordination from application, and application

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Four men were conversing together, when the
following resolution was suggested:&mdash;"Whosoever
can make Inaction the head, Life the backbone, and
Death the tail, of his existence,&mdash;that man shall be
admitted to friendship with us." The four looked
at each other and smiled; and tacitly accepting the
conditions, became friends forthwith.</p>

<p>By-and-by, one of them, named Tzŭ Yü, fell ill,
and another, Tzŭ Ssŭ, went to see him. "Verily
God is great!" said the sick man. "See how he
has doubled me up. My back is so hunched that
my viscera are at the top of my body. My cheeks
are level with my navel. My shoulders are higher
than my neck. My hair grows up towards the sky.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
The whole economy of my organism is deranged.
Nevertheless, my mental equilibrium is not disturbed."
So saying, he dragged himself painfully
to a well, where he could see himself, and continued,
"Alas, that God should have doubled me
up like this!"</p>

<p>"Are you afraid?" asked Tzŭ Ssŭ.</p>

<p>"I am not," replied Tzŭ Yü. "What have I to
fear? Ere long I shall be decomposed. My left
shoulder will become a cock, and I shall herald the
approach of morn. My right shoulder will become
a cross-bow, and I shall be able to get broiled duck.
My buttocks will become wheels; and with my
soul for a horse, I shall be able to ride in my own
chariot. I obtained life because it was my time:
I am now parting with it in accordance with the
same law. Content with the natural sequence of
these states, joy and sorrow touch me not. I am
simply, as the ancients expressed it, hanging in the
air, unable to cut myself down, bound with the
trammels of material existence. But man has ever
given way before God: why, then, should I be
afraid?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"What comes from God to us, returns from us to
God."&mdash;<cite>Plato.</cite></p></div>

<p>By-and-by, another of the four, named Tzŭ Lai,
fell ill, and lay gasping for breath, while his family
stood weeping around. The fourth friend, Tzŭ Li,
went to see him. "Chut!" cried he to the wife
and children; "begone! you balk his decomposition."
Then, leaning against the door, he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
"Verily, God is great! I wonder what he will
make of you now. I wonder whither you will be
sent. Do you think he will make you into a rat's
liver</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Chinese believe that a rat has no liver.</p></div>

<p>or into the shoulders of a snake?"</p>

<p>"A son," answered Tzŭ Lai, "must go whithersoever
his parents bid him. Nature is no other
than a man's parents.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The term "Nature" stands here as a rendering of
<em>Yin</em> and <em>Yang</em>, the Positive and Negative Principles
of Chinese cosmogony, from whose interaction the
visible universe results.</p></div>

<p>If she bid me die quickly, and I demur, then I am
an unfilial son. She can do me no wrong. <span class="smcap">Tao</span>
gives me this form, this toil in manhood, this
repose in old age, this rest in death. And surely
that which is such a kind arbiter of my life is the
best arbiter of my death.</p>

<p>"Suppose that the boiling metal in a smelting-pot
were to bubble up and say, 'Make of me an
Excalibur;' I think the caster would reject that
metal as uncanny. And if a sinner like myself
were to say to God, 'Make of me a man, make of
me a man;' I think he too would reject me as
uncanny. The universe is the smelting-pot, and
God is the caster. I shall go whithersoever I am
sent, to wake unconscious of the past, as a man
wakes from a dreamless sleep."</p>

<p>Tzŭ Sang Hu, Mêng Tzŭ Fan, and Tzŭ Ch'in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Chang, were conversing together, when it was
asked, "Who can be, and yet not be?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Implying the absence of all consciousness.</p></div>

<p>Who can do, and yet not do?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By virtue of inaction.</p></div>

<p>Who can mount to heaven, and roaming through
the clouds, pass beyond the limits of space, oblivious
of existence, for ever and ever without end?"</p>

<p>The three looked at each other and smiled; and
as neither had any misgivings, they became friends
accordingly.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Tzŭ Sang Hu died; whereupon
Confucius sent Tzŭ Kung</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One of his chief disciples.</p></div>

<p>to take part in the mourning. But Tzŭ Kung
found that one had composed a song which the
other was accompanying on the lute,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Strictly speaking, a kind of zitha, played with two
hammers.</p></div>

<p>as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">Ah! Wilt thou come back to us, Sang Hu?</div>
   <div class="verse">Ah! Wilt thou come back to us, Sang Hu?</div>
   <div class="verse">Thou hast already returned to thy God,</div>
   <div class="verse">While we still remain here as men,&mdash;alas!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Tzŭ Kung hurried in and said, "How can you
sing alongside of a corpse? Is this decorum?"</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other and laughed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
saying, "What should this man know of decorum
indeed?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Not the outward decorum of the body, but the
inward decorum of the heart.</p></div>

<p>Tzŭ Kung went back and told Confucius, asking
him, "What manner of men are these? Their
object is nothingness and a separation from their
corporeal frames.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Various commentators give various renderings of
this sentence,&mdash;mostly forced.</p></div>

<p>They can sit near a corpse and yet sing, unmoved.
There is no class for such. What are they?"</p>

<p>"These men," replied Confucius, "travel beyond
the rule of life. I travel within it. Consequently,
our paths do not meet; and I was wrong in sending
you to mourn. They consider themselves as one
with God, recognising no distinctions between
human and divine. They look on life as a huge
tumour from which death sets them free. All the
same they know not where they were before birth,
nor where they will be after death. Though
admitting different elements, they take their stand
upon the unity of all things. They ignore their
passions. They take no count of their ears and
eyes. Backwards and forwards through all eternity,
they do not admit a beginning or end. They stroll
beyond the dust and dirt of mortality, to wander
in the realms of inaction. How should such men
trouble themselves with the conventionalities of
this world, or care what people may think of them?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"But if such is the case," said Tzŭ Kung,
"why should we stick to the rule?"</p>

<p>"Heaven has condemned me to this," replied
Confucius. "Nevertheless, you and I may perhaps
escape from it."</p>

<p>"By what method?" asked Tzŭ Kung.</p>

<p>"Fishes," replied Confucius, "are born in water.
Man is born in <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. If fishes get ponds to live in,
they thrive. If man gets <span class="smcap">Tao</span> to live in, he may
live his life in peace.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Without reference to the outward ceremonial of this
world.</p></div>

<p>Hence the saying, 'All that a fish wants is water;
all that a man wants is <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.'"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is of course by a literary <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de main</i> that
Confucius is here and elsewhere made to stand
sponsor to the <span class="smcap">Tao</span> of the rival school.</p></div>

<p>"May I ask," said Tzŭ Kung, "about divine
men?"</p>

<p>"Divine men," replied Confucius, "are divine to
man, but ordinary to God. Hence the saying that
the meanest being in heaven would be the best
on earth; and the best on earth, the meanest in
heaven."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Man is a kind of very minute heaven. God is the
grand man."&mdash;<cite>Swedenborg.</cite></p></div>

<p>Yen Hui said to Confucius, "When Mêng Sun
Ts'ai's mother died, he wept, but without snivelling;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Which the Chinese regard as the test of real sorrow.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>he grieved but his grief was not heartfelt; he wore
mourning but without howling. Yet although
wanting in these three points, he is considered the
best mourner in the State of Lu. Surely this is
the name and not the reality. I am astonished at
it."</p>

<p>"Mêng Sun," said Confucius, "did all that was
required. He has made an advance towards
wisdom.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Towards <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, wherein there is no weeping nor
gnashing of teeth.</p></div>

<p>He could not do less;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Than mourn outwardly, for fear of committing a
breach of social etiquette, in harmony if not in
accordance with which the true Sage passes his life.</p></div>

<p>while all the time actually doing less.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As seen from the absence of those signs which prove
inward grief.</p></div>

<p>"Mêng Sun knows not whence we come nor
whither we go. He knows not whether the end
will come early or late. Passing into life as a man,
he quietly awaits his passage into the unknown.
What should the dead know of the living, or the
living know of the dead? Even you and I may be
in a dream from which we have not yet awaked.</p>

<p>"Then again, he adapts himself physically,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To the ceremonial of the body.</p></div>

<p>while avoiding injury to his higher self.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Keeping his soul free from the disturbance of
passion.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>He regards a dying man simply as one who is
going home. He sees others weep, and he
naturally weeps too.</p>

<p>"Besides, a man's personality is something of
which he is subjectively conscious. It is impossible
for him to say if he is really that which he is
conscious of being. You dream you are a bird,
and soar to heaven. You dream you are a fish,
and dive into the ocean's depths. And you cannot
tell whether the man now speaking is awake or in
a dream.</p>

<p>"A pleasurable sensation precedes the smile it
evokes. The smile itself is not dependent upon a

<p>I Erh Tzŭ went to see Hsü Yu. The latter
asked him, saying, "How has Yao benefited you?"</p>

<p>"He bade me," replied the former, "practise
charity and do my duty, and distinguish clearly
between right and wrong."</p>

<p>"Then what do you want here?" said Hsü Yu.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
"If Yao has already branded you with charity
and duty, and cut off your nose with right and
wrong, what do you do in this free-and-easy, care-for-nobody,
topsy-turvy neighbourhood?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p></div>

<p>"Nevertheless," replied I Erh Tzŭ, "I should
like to be on its confines."</p>

<p>"If a man has lost his eyes," retorted Hsü Yu,
"it is impossible for him to join in the appreciation
of beauty. A man with a film over his eyes
cannot tell a blue sacrificial robe from a yellow
one."</p>

<p>"Wu Chuang's disregard of her beauty," answered
I Erh Tzŭ, "Chü Liang's disregard of his
strength, the Yellow Emperor's abandonment of
wisdom,&mdash;all these were brought about by a process
of filing and hammering. And how do you
know but that God would rid me of my brands,
and give me a new nose, and make me fit to become
a disciple of yourself?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" replied Hsü Yu, "that cannot be known.
But I will just give you an outline. The Master I
serve succours all things, and does not account it
<em>duty</em>. He continues his blessings through countless
generations, and does not account it <em>charity</em>.
Dating back to the remotest antiquity, he does not
account himself old. Covering heaven, supporting
earth, and fashioning the various forms of things,
he does not account himself skilled. He it is
whom you should seek."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I am getting on," observed Yen Hui to
Confucius.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The most famous of all the disciples of Confucius,
admitted by the latter to have been as near perfection
as possible.</p></div>

<p>"How so?" asked the latter.</p>

<p>"I have got rid of charity and duty," replied the
former.</p>

<p>"Very good," replied Confucius, "but not
perfect."</p>

<p>Another day Yen Hui met Confucius and said,
"I am getting on."</p>

<p>"How so?" asked Confucius.</p>

<p>"I have got rid of ceremonial and music,"
answered Yen Hui.</p>

<p>"Very good," said Confucius, "but not perfect."</p>

<p>On a third occasion Yen Hui met Confucius and
said, "I am getting on."</p>

<p>"How so?" asked the Sage.</p>

<p>"I have got rid of everything," replied Yen
Hui.</p>

<p>"Got rid of everything!" said Confucius eagerly.
"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"I have freed myself from my body," answered
Yen Hui. "I have discarded my reasoning powers.
And by thus getting rid of body and mind, I have
become <span class="smcap">One</span> with the Infinite. This is what I
mean by getting rid of everything."</p>

<p>"If you have become <span class="smcap">One</span>," cried Confucius,
"there can be no room for bias. If you have
passed into space, you are indeed without begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>ning

<p>Tzŭ Yü and Tzŭ Sang were friends. Once when
it had rained for ten days, Tzŭ Yü said, "Tzŭ
Sang is dangerously ill." So he packed up some
food and went to see him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In accordance with the exigencies of mortality.
How Tzŭ Yü knew that his friend was ill is not
clear. An attempt has been made by one commentator
on the basis of animal magnetism, in which
the Chinese have believed for centuries.</p></div>

<p>Arriving at the door, he heard something between
singing and lamentation, accompanied with the
sound of music, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"O father! O mother! O Heaven! O Man!"</p>

<p>These words seemed to be uttered with a great
effort; whereupon Tzŭ Yü went in and asked what
it all meant.</p>

<p>"I was trying to think who could have brought
me to this extreme," replied Tzŭ Sang, "but I
could not guess. My father and mother would
hardly wish me to be poor. Heaven covers all
equally. Earth supports all equally. How can
they make me in particular poor? I was seeking
to know who it was, but without success. Surely
then I am brought to this extreme by <em>Destiny</em>."</p>

Thereat the former was greatly delighted,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For now he discovered that ignorance is true knowledge:&mdash;an
explanation which I adopt only for want

<p>and went off and told P'u I Tzŭ.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of whom nothing definite is known.</p></div>

<p>"Have you only just found that out?" said P'u
I Tzŭ. "The Emperor Shun was not equal to T'ai
Huang.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A legendary ruler. For Shun, see <a href="#Page_1">ch. i</a>.</p></div>

<p>Shun was all for charity in his zeal for mankind;
but although he succeeded in government, he himself
never rose above the level of artificiality. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
T'ai Huang was peaceful when asleep and inactive
when awake. At one time he would think himself
a horse; at another, an ox.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>So effectually had he closed all channels leading to
consciousness of self.</p></div>

<p>His wisdom was substantial and above suspicion.
His virtue was genuine indeed. And yet he never

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He was a monarch after the pattern of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Chien Wu meeting the eccentric Chieh Yü, the
latter enquired, saying, "What did Jih Chung Shih
teach you?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of the last nothing is known. The first two have
been already mentioned in chs. <a href="#Page_1">i</a>. and <a href="#Page_68">vi</a>.</p></div>

<p>"He taught me," replied Chien Wu, "about
the laws and regulations which princes evolve, and
which he said none would venture not to hear and
obey."</p>

<p>"That is a false teaching indeed," replied Chieh
Yü. "To attempt to govern mankind thus,&mdash;as
well try to wade through the sea, to hew a passage
through a river, or make a mosquito fly away with
a mountain!</p>

<p>"The government of the truly wise man has no

what he wants.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That you should be unable to devise means of
avoiding the artificial restraints of princes. Better

<p>T'ien Kên</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of whom nothing is known.</p></div>

<p>was travelling on the south of the Yin mountain.
He had reached the river Liao when he met a
certain Sage to whom he said, "I beg to ask about
the government of the empire."</p>

<p>"Begone!" cried the Sage. "You are a low
fellow, and your question is ill timed. God has
just turned me out a man. That is enough for me.
Borne on light pinions I can soar beyond the cardinal
points, to the land of nowhere, in the domain
of nothingness. And you come to worry me with
government of the empire!"</p>

<p>But T'ien Kên enquired a second time, and the
Sage replied, "Resolve your mental energy into
abstraction, your physical energy into inaction.
Allow yourself to fall in with the natural order of
phenomena, without admitting the element of self,&mdash;and
the empire will be governed."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By virtue of natural laws which lead, without man's
interference, to the end desired.</p></div>

<p>Yang Tzŭ Chü went to see Lao Tzŭ, and said,
"Suppose a man were ardent and courageous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
acquainted with the order and principles of things,
and untiring in the pursuit of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>&mdash;would he be
accounted a wise ruler?"</p>

<p>"From the point of view of a truly wise man,"
replied Lao Tzŭ, "such a one would be a mere
handicraftsman, wearing out body and mind alike.
The tiger and the pard suffer from the beauty of
their skins. The cleverness of the monkey, the
tractability of the ox, bring them both to the tether.
It is not on such grounds that a ruler may be
accounted wise."</p>

<p>"But in what, then," cried Yang Tzŭ Chü, "does
the government of a wise man consist?"</p>

<p>"The goodness of a wise ruler," answered Lao
Tzŭ, "covers the whole empire, yet he himself
seems to know it not. It influences all creation,
yet none is conscious thereof. It appears under
countless forms, bringing joy to all things. It is
based upon the baseless, and travels through the
realms of Nowhere."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The operation of true government is invisible to the
eye of man.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the State of Chêng there was a wonderful
magician, named Chi Han. He knew all about
birth and death, gain and loss, misfortune and
happiness, long life and short life,&mdash;predicting
events to a day with supernatural accuracy. The
people of Chêng used to flee at his approach; but
Lieh Tzŭ</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See <a href="#Page_1">ch. i</a>.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>went to see him, and became so infatuated that on
his return he said to Hu Tzŭ,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Who appears to have been his tutor.</p></div>

<p>"I used to look upon your <span class="smcap">Tao</span> as perfect. Now I
know something more perfect still."</p>

<p>"So far," replied Hu Tzŭ, "I have only taught
you the ornamentals, not the essentials, of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>;
and yet you think you know all about it. Without
cocks in your poultry-yard, what sort of eggs do the
hens lay? If you go about trying to force <span class="smcap">Tao</span>
down people's throats, you will be simply exposing
yourself. Bring your friend with you, and let me
show myself to him."</p>

<p>So next day Lieh Tzŭ went with Chi Han to see
Hu Tzŭ, and when they came out Chi Han said,
"Alas! your teacher is doomed. He cannot live.
I hardly give him ten days. I am astonished at
him. He is but wet ashes."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And cannot burn much longer.</p></div>

<p>Lieh Tzŭ went in and wept bitterly, and told
Hu Tzŭ; but the latter said, "I showed myself
to him just now as the earth shows us its outward
form, motionless and still, while production
is all the time going on. I merely prevented him
from seeing my pent-up energy</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p></div>

<p>within. Bring him again."</p>

<p>Next day the interview took place as before; but
as they were leaving Chi Han said to Lieh Tzŭ,
"It is lucky for your teacher that he met me. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
is better. He will recover. I saw he had recuperative
power."</p>

<p>Lieh Tzŭ went in and told Hu Tzŭ; whereupon
the latter replied, "I showed myself to him just
now as heaven shows itself in all its dispassionate
grandeur, letting a little energy run out of my heels.
He was thus able to detect that I had some. Bring
him here again."</p>

<p>Next day a third interview took place, and as
they were leaving, Chi Han said to Lieh Tzŭ,
"Your teacher is never one day like another. I can
tell nothing from his physiognomy. Get him to be
regular, and I will then examine him again."</p>

<p>This being repeated to Hu Tzŭ as before, the
latter said, "I showed myself to him just now in a
state of harmonious equilibrium. Where the whale
disports itself,&mdash;is the abyss. Where water is at
rest,&mdash;is the abyss. Where water is in motion,&mdash;is
the abyss. The abyss has nine names. These
are three of them."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Alluding to three phases of <span class="smcap">Tao</span> as manifested at
the three interviews above described, <span class="smcap">Tao</span> being the
abyss.</p></div>

<p>Next day the two went once more to see Hu
Tzŭ; but Chi Han was unable to stand still, and in
his confusion turned and fled.</p>

<p>"Pursue him!" cried Hu Tzŭ; whereupon Lieh
Tzŭ ran after him, but could not overtake him, so
he returned and told Hu Tzŭ that the fugitive had
disappeared.</p>

<p>"I showed myself to him just now," said Hu Tzŭ,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
"as <span class="smcap">Tao</span> appeared before time was. I was to him
as a great blank, existing of itself. He knew not
who I was. His face fell. He became confused.
And so he fled."</p>

<p>Upon this Lieh Tzŭ stood convinced that he
had not yet acquired any real knowledge, and at
once set to work in earnest, passing three years
without leaving the house. He helped his wife to
cook the family dinner, and fed his pigs just like
human beings. He discarded the artificial and
reverted to the natural. He became merely a shape.
Amidst confusion,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of this material world.</p></div>

<p>he was unconfounded. And so he continued to the
end.</p>

<p>By Inaction, fame comes as the spirits of the
dead come to the boy who impersonates the corpse.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See <a href="#Page_1">ch. i</a>. In the old funeral rites of China, a boy
was made to sit speechless and motionless as a
corpse, for the reason assigned in the text.</p></div>

<p>By Inaction, one can become the centre of thought,
the focus of responsibility, the arbiter of wisdom.
Full allowance must be made for others, while
remaining unmoved oneself. There must be a
thorough compliance with divine principles, without
any manifestation thereof.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Non mihi res, sed me rebus, subjungere conar.</p></div>

<p>All of which may be summed up in the one word
<em>passivity</em>. For the perfect man employs his mind
as a mirror. It grasps nothing: it refuses nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
It receives, but does not keep. And thus he can
triumph over matter, without injury to himself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The ruler of the southern sea was called Shu.
The ruler of the northern sea was called Hu. The
ruler of the central zone was called Hun Tun.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This term is generally used to denote the condition
of matter before separation and subdivision into the
phenomena of the visible universe.</p></div>

<p>Shu and Hu often met on Hun Tun's territory,
and being always well treated by him, determined
to repay his kindness.</p>

<p>They said, "All men have seven holes,&mdash;for
seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing. Hun Tun
alone has none. We will bore some for him."</p>

<p>So every day they bored one hole; but on the
seventh day Hun Tun died.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Joined Toes.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Argument</i>:&mdash;Virtues should be natural, not artificial; passive not active.
[Chs. <a href="#Page_220">viii</a> to <a href="#Page_294">xiii</a> inclusive are illustrative of, or supplementary to,
<a href="#Page_91">ch. vii</a>.]</p></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Joined</span> toes and extra fingers are an addition
to nature, though, functionally speaking,
superfluous. Wens and tumours are an addition
to the bodily form, though, as far as nature is concerned,
superfluous. And similarly, to include
charity and duty to one's neighbour among the
functions of man's organism, is not true <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The whole of this chapter is a violent tirade against
the leading doctrines of Confucianism.</p></div>

<p>For just as joined toes are but useless lumps of
flesh, and extra fingers but useless excrescences, so
are any artificial additions to our internal economy
but harmful adjuncts to real charity and duty to
one's neighbour,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Which are the outcome of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p></div>

<p>and are moreover prejudicial to the right use of
intelligence.</p>

<p>People with extra keenness of vision muddle
themselves over the five colours, exaggerate the
value of shades, and of distinctions of greens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and yellows for sacrificial robes. Of such was
Li Chu.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Who could see a pin's point at a distance of 1,000 <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i>.
He is mentioned by Mencius.</p></div>

<p>People with extra keenness of hearing muddle
themselves over the five notes, exaggerate the tonic
differences of the six pitch-pipes, and the various
<em>timbres</em> of metal, stone, silk, and bamboo, of the
<em>Huang-chung</em>, and of the <em>Ta-lü</em>. Of such was
Shih K'uang.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The blind musician mentioned in <a href="#Page_12">ch. ii</a>. The
<em>Huang-chung</em> and the <em>Ta-lü</em> were two of the
twelve bamboo tubes, or pitch-pipes, on which
ancient Chinese music was based. Six were <em>male</em>
or positive, and six <em>female</em> or negative. Hence
they are spoken of collectively as six.</p></div>

<p>People who graft on charity, force themselves to
display this virtue in order to gain reputation and
to enjoy the applause of the world for that which
is of no account. Of such were Tsêng and Shih.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Tsêng Shên, a famous disciple of Confucius, and Shih
Yu, both noted for their high moral characters.</p></div>

<p>People who refine in argument do but pile up
tiles or knot ropes in their maunderings over the
hard and white, the like and the unlike, wearing
themselves out over mere useless terms. Of such
were Yang and Mih.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Yang Chu, a philosopher of the fourth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
whose "selfish" system was condemned by Mencius;
and Mih Tzŭ, already mentioned in <a href="#Page_12">ch. ii</a>.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore every addition to or deviation from
nature belongs not to the ultimate perfection of all.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Which is in <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p></div>

<p>He who would attain to such perfection never
loses sight of the natural conditions of his existence.
With him the joined is not united, nor the
separated apart, nor the long in excess, nor the
short wanting. For just as a duck's legs, though
short, cannot be lengthened without pain to the
duck, and a crane's legs, though long, cannot be
shortened without misery to the crane, so that
which is long in man's moral nature cannot be cut
off, nor that which is short be lengthened. All
sorrow is thus avoided.</p>

<p>Intentional charity and intentional duty to one's
neighbour are surely not included in our moral
nature. Yet what sorrow these have involved.
Divide your joined toes and you will howl: bite off
your extra finger and you will scream. In one case
there is too much, in the other too little; but the
sorrow is the same. And the charitable of the age
go about sorrowing over the ills of the age, while
the non-charitable cut through the natural conditions
of things in their greed after place and
wealth. Surely then intentional charity and duty
to one's neighbour are not included in our moral
nature. Yet from the time of the Three Dynasties
downwards what a fuss has been made about them!</p>

<p>Those who cannot make perfect without arc, line,
compasses, and square, injure the natural constitu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>tion
of things. Those who require cords to bind and
glue to stick, interfere with the natural functions of
things. And those who seek to satisfy the mind of
man by hampering with ceremonies and music and
preaching charity and duty to one's neighbour,
thereby destroy the intrinsicality of things.</p>

<p>For such intrinsicality does exist, in this sense:&mdash;Things
which are curved require no arcs; things
which are straight require no lines; things which
are round require no compasses; things which are
rectangular require no squares; things which stick
require no glue; things which hold together require
no cords. And just as all things are produced,
and none can tell how they are produced, so do
all things possess their own intrinsic qualities
and none can tell how they possess them. From
time immemorial this has always been so, without
variation. Why then should charity and duty to
one's neighbour be as it were glued or corded on,
and introduced into the domain of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, to give
rise to doubt among mankind?</p>

<p>Lesser doubts change the rule of life; greater
doubts change man's nature.</p>

<p>How do we know this? By the fact that ever
since the time when Shun bid for charity and duty
to one's neighbour in order to secure the empire,
men have devoted their lives to the pursuit thereof.
Is it not then charity and duty to one's neighbour
which change the nature of man?</p>

<p>Therefore I have tried to show that from the
time of the Three Dynasties it has always been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
external which has changed the nature of man. If
a mean man, he will die for gain. If a superior
man, he will die for fame. If a man of rank, he
will die for his ancestral honours. If a Sage, he
will die for the world. The pursuits and ambitions
of these men differ, but the injury to their
natures involved in the sacrifice of their lives is the
same.</p>

<p>Tsang and Ku were shepherds, both of whom
lost their flocks. On inquiry, it appeared that
Tsang had been engaged in reading, while Ku had
gone to take part in some trials of strength. Their
occupations had been different, but the result was
in each case loss of the sheep.</p>

<p>Poh I died for fame at the foot of Mount Shou-yang.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See <a href="#Page_68">ch. vi</a>.</p></div>

<p>Robber Chê died for gain on Mount T'ai.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Robber Chê has a chapter to himself, from which,
though spurious, it may be gathered that he was a
very remarkable personage in his day.</p>

<p>Mount T'ai has been mentioned in <a href="#Page_1">ch. i</a>.</p></div>

<p>Their deaths were not the same, but the injury to
their lives and natures was in each case the same.
How then can we applaud the former and blame
the latter?</p>

<p>And so, if a man dies for charity and duty to his
neighbour the world calls him a noble fellow;
but if he dies for gain, the world calls him a
low fellow. The dying being the same, one is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
nevertheless called noble and the other low. But
in point of injury to life and nature, the robber
Chê and Poh I are one. Where then does the
distinction of noble and low come in?</p>

<p>Were a man to apply himself to charity and
duty towards his neighbour until he were the equal
of Tsêng or Shih, this would not be what I mean
by perfection. Or to flavours, until he were the
equal of Yü Erh.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Probably identical with I Ya, the Soyer of China.</p></div>

<p>Or to sounds, until he were the equal of Shih
K'uang. Or to colours, until he were the equal of
Li Chu. What I mean by perfection is not what
is meant by charity and duty to one's neighbour.
It is found in the cultivation of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. And those
whom I regard as cultivators of <span class="smcap">Tao</span> are not those
who cultivate charity and duty to one's neighbour.
They are those who yield to the natural conditions
of things. What I call perfection of hearing is
not hearing others but oneself. What I call perfection
of vision is not seeing others but oneself.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A saying attributed by Han Fei Tzŭ to Lao Tzŭ:&mdash;"To
see oneself is to be clear of sight." See <cite>The
Remains of Lao Tzŭ</cite>, p. 18.</p></div>

<p>For a man who sees not himself but others, takes
not possession of himself but of others, thus taking
what others should take and not what he himself
should take.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Multi sunt, qui urbes, qui populos habuere in
potestate, paucissimi, qui se.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of being himself, he in fact becomes some
one else. And if a man thus becomes some one
else instead of himself, this is a fatal error of which
both the robber Chê and Poh I can be equally
guilty.</p>

<p>And so, conscious of my own deficiency in
regard to <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, I do not venture at my best to
practise the principles of charity and duty to my
neighbour, nor at my worst to fall into the fatal
error above-mentioned.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Horses' Hoofs.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Argument</i>:&mdash;Superiority of the natural over the artificial&mdash;Application of
this principle to government.</p></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Horses</span> have hoofs to carry them over frost
and snow; hair, to protect them from wind
and cold. They eat grass and drink water, and
fling up their heels over the champaign. Such is
the real nature of horses. Palatial dwellings are of
no use to them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One day Poh Loh</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A Chinese Rarey, of somewhat legendary character.</p></div>

<p>appeared, saying, "I understand the management
of horses."</p>

<p>So he branded them, and clipped them, and pared
their hoofs, and put halters on them, tying them up
by the head and shackling them by the feet, and
disposing them in stables, with the result that two
or three in every ten died. Then he kept them
hungry and thirsty, trotting them and galloping
them, and grooming, and trimming, with the misery
of the tasselled bridle before and the fear of the
knotted whip behind, until more than half of them
were dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The potter says, "I can do what I will with clay.
If I want it round, I use compasses; if rectangular,
a square."</p>

<p>The carpenter says, "I can do what I will with
wood. If I want it curved, I use an arc; if straight,
a line."</p>

<p>But on what grounds can we think that the
natures of clay and wood desire this application of
compasses and square, of arc and line? Nevertheless,
every age extols Poh Loh for his skill in
managing horses, and potters and carpenters for
their skill with clay and wood. Those who <em>govern</em>
the empire make the same mistake.</p>

<p>Now I regard government of the empire from
quite a different point of view.</p>

<p>The people have certain natural instincts;&mdash;to
weave and clothe themselves, to till and feed themselves.
These are common to all humanity, and
all are agreed thereon. Such instincts are called
"Heaven-sent."</p>

<p>And so in the days when natural instincts prevailed,
men moved quietly and gazed steadily. At
that time, there were no roads over mountains, nor
boats, nor bridges over water. All things were
produced, each for its own proper sphere. Birds
and beasts multiplied; trees and shrubs grew up.
The former might be led by the hand; you could
climb up and peep into the raven's nest. For then
man dwelt with birds and beasts, and all creation
was one. There were no distinctions of good and
bad men. Being all equally without knowledge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
their virtue could not go astray. Being all equally
without evil desires, they were in a state of natural
integrity, the perfection of human existence.</p>

<p>But when Sages appeared, tripping people over
charity and fettering with duty to one's neighbour,
doubt found its way into the world. And then with
their gushing over music and fussing over ceremony,
the empire became divided against itself.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Music and ceremonies are important factors in the
Confucian system of government.</p></div>

<p>Were the natural integrity of things left unharmed,
who could make sacrificial vessels? Were
white jade left unbroken, who could make the
regalia of courts? Were Tao not abandoned, who
could introduce charity and duty to one's neighbour?
Were man's natural instincts his guide,
what need would there be for music and ceremonies?
Were the five colours not confused, who would
practise decoration? Were the five notes not
confused, who would adopt the six pitch-pipes?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See chs. <a href="#Page_99">viii</a> and <a href="#Page_110">x</a>.</p></div>

<p>Destruction of the natural integrity of things, in
order to produce articles of various kinds,&mdash;this is
the fault of the artisan. Annihilation of <span class="smcap">Tao</span> in
order to practise charity and duty to one's neighbour,&mdash;this
is the error of the Sage.</p>

<p>Horses live on dry land, eat grass and drink
water. When pleased, they rub their necks
together. When angry, they turn around and kick
up their heels at each other. Thus far only do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
their natural dispositions carry them. But bridled
and bitted, with a plate of metal on their foreheads,
they learn to cast vicious looks, to turn the head
to bite, to resist, to get the bit out of the mouth or
the bridle into it. And thus their natures become
depraved,&mdash;the fault of Poh Loh.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the days of Ho Hsü</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A legendary ruler of old.</p></div>

<p>the people did nothing in particular when at rest,
and went nowhere in particular when they moved.
Having food, they rejoiced; having full bellies,
they strolled about. Such were the capacities of
the people. But when the Sages came to worry
them with ceremonies and music in order to rectify
the form of government, and dangled charity and
duty to one's neighbour before them in order to
satisfy their hearts,&mdash;then the people began to
develop a taste for knowledge and to struggle one
with the other in their desire for gain. This was
the error of the Sages.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The simplicity of style, and general intelligibility of
this chapter have raised doubts as to its genuineness.
But as Lin Hsi Chung justly observes, its sympathetic
tone in relation to dumb animals, stamps it,

as beyond reach of the forger's art.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Opening Trunks.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Argument</i>:&mdash;All restrictions artificial, and therefore deceptive&mdash;Only by
shaking off such fetters, and reverting to the natural, can man hope
to attain.</p></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> precautions taken against thieves who open
trunks, search bags, or ransack tills, consist
of securing with cords and fastening with bolts and
locks. This is what the world calls wit.</p>

<p>But a strong thief comes who carries off the till
on his shoulders, with box and bag to boot. And
his only fear is that the cords and locks should not
be strong enough!</p>

<p>Therefore, what the world calls wit, simply
amounts to assistance given to the strong thief.</p>

<p>And I venture to state that nothing of that which
the world calls wit, is otherwise than serviceable to
strong thieves; and that nothing of that which the
world calls wisdom is other than a protection to
strong thieves.</p>

<p>How can this be shown?&mdash;In the State of Ch'i a
man used to be able to see from one town to the
next, and hear the barking and crowing of its dogs
and cocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>So near were they. This sentence has been incorporated
in ch. <span class="smcap">LXXX</span> of the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>. See <cite>The
Remains of Lao Tzŭ</cite>, p. 50.</p></div>

<p>The area covered by the nets of fishermen and
fowlers, and pricked by the plough, was a square of
two thousand and odd <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of which three go to a mile, roughly. This statement
is intended to convey an idea of prosperity.</p></div>

<p>And within its four boundaries not a temple or
shrine was dedicated, nor a district or hamlet
governed, but in accordance with the rules laid
down by the Sages.</p>

<p>Yet one morning</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 481.</p></div>

<p>T'ien Ch'êng Tzŭ slew the Prince of Ch'i, and stole
his kingdom. And not his kingdom only, but the
wisdom-tricks which he had got from the Sages as
well; so that although T'ien Ch'êng Tzŭ acquired
the reputation of a thief, he lived as comfortably as
ever did either Yao or Shun. The small States
did not venture to blame, nor the great States to
punish him; and so for twelve generations his
descendants ruled over Ch'i.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Commentators have failed to explain away this last
sentence. On the strength of an obvious anachronism,
some have written off the whole chapter as a
forgery; but the general style of argument is against
this view.</p></div>

<p>Was not this stealing the State of Ch'i and the
wisdom-tricks of the Sages as well in order to
secure himself from the consequences of such theft?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>This amounts to what I have already said,
namely that nothing of what the world esteems
great wit is otherwise than serviceable to strong
thieves, and that nothing of what the world calls
great wisdom is other than a protection to strong
thieves.</p>

<p>Let us take another example. Of old, Lung
Fêng was beheaded, Pi Kan was disembowelled,
Chang Hung was sliced to death, Tzŭ Hsü was
chopped to mince-meat.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The first two have been already mentioned in <a href="#Page_38">ch. iv</a>.
Chang Hung was minister to Prince Ling of the
Chou dynasty. Tzŭ Hsü was a name of the famous
Wu Yüan, prime minister of the Ch'u State, whose
corpse is said to have been sewn up in a sack and
thrown into the river near Soochow.</p></div>

<p>All these four were Sages, but their wisdom could
not preserve them from death.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In fact, it rather hastened their ends.</p></div>

<p>An apprentice to Robber Chê asked him saying,
"Is there then <span class="smcap">Tao</span> in thieving?"</p>

<p>"Pray tell me of something in which there is not
<span class="smcap">Tao</span>," Chê replied. "There is the <em>wisdom</em> by
which booty is located. The <em>courage</em> to go in first,
and the <em>heroism</em> of coming out last. There is the
<em>shrewdness</em> of calculating success, and <em>justice</em> in
the equal division of the spoil. There has never
yet been, a great robber who was not possessed of
these five."</p>

<p>Thus the doctrine of the Sages is equally indis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>pensable
to good men and to Chê. But good men
are scarce and bad men plentiful, so that the good
the Sages do to the world is little and the evil
great.</p>

<p>Therefore it has been said, "If the lips are
gone, the teeth will be cold." It was the thinness
of the wine of Lu which caused the siege of
Han Tan.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The prince of Ch'u held an assembly, to which the
princes of Lu and Chao brought presents of wine.
That of Lu was poor stuff, while the wine of Chao
was rich and generous. Because, however, the
Master of the Cellar to the prince of Ch'u failed to
get a bribe of wine from the prince of Chao, he
maliciously changed the presents; and the prince
of Ch'u, displeased at what he regarded as an
insult, shortly after laid siege to Han Tan, the chief
city of Chao.</p></div>

<p>It was the appearance of Sages which caused the
appearance of great robbers.</p>

<p>Drive out the Sages and leave the robbers alone,&mdash;then
only will the empire be governed. As when
the stream ceases the gully dries up, and when the
hill is levelled the chasm is filled; so when Sages
are extinct, there will be no more robbers, but the
empire will rest in peace.</p>

<p>On the other hand, unless Sages disappear,
neither will great robbers disappear; nor if you
double the number of Sages wherewithal to govern
the empire will you do more than double the profits
of Robber Chê.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>If pecks and bushels are used for measurement,
they will also be stolen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There will simply be something more to steal.</p></div>

<p>If scales and steelyards are used for weighing, they
will also be stolen. If tallies and signets are used
for good faith, they will also be stolen. If charity
and duty to one's neighbour are used for rectification,
they will also be stolen.</p>

<p>How is this so?&mdash;One man steals a purse, and is
punished. Another steals a State, and becomes a
Prince. But charity and duty to one's neighbour
are integral parts of princedom. Does he not then
steal charity and duty to one's neighbour together
with the wisdom of the Sages?</p>

<p>So it is that to attempt to drive out great
robbers</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Who steal States.</p></div>

<p>is simply to help them to steal principalities, charity,
duty to one's neighbour, together with measures,
scales, tallies, and signets. No reward of official
regalia and uniform will dissuade, nor dread of
sharp instruments of punishment will deter such
men from their course. These do but double
the profits of robbers like Chê, and make it impossible
to get rid of them,&mdash;for which the Sages are
responsible.</p>

<p>Therefore it has been said, "Fishes cannot be
taken away from water: the instruments of government
cannot be delegated to others."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>These words were uttered by Lao Tzŭ. So say
Han Fei Tzŭ and Huai Nan Tzŭ. They have been
incorporated in ch. xxxvi of the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>.</p></div>

<p>In the wisdom of Sages the instruments of
government are found. This wisdom is not fit
for enlightening the world.</p>

<p>Away then with wisdom and knowledge, and
great robbers will disappear! Discard jade and
destroy pearls, and petty thieves will cease to exist.
Burn tallies and break signets, and the people will
revert to their natural integrity. Split measures
and smash scales, and the people will not fight over
quantities. Utterly abolish all the restrictions of
Sages, and the people will begin to be fit for the
reception of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p>

<p>Confuse the six pitch-pipes, break up organs and
flutes, stuff up the ears of Shih K'uang,&mdash;and each
man will keep his own sense of hearing to himself.</p>

<p>Put an end to decoration, disperse the five categories
of colour, glue up the eyes of Li Chu,&mdash;and
each man will keep his own sense of sight to
himself.</p>

<p>Destroy arcs and lines, fling away square and
compasses, snap off the fingers of Kung Ch'ui,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A famous artisan who could draw an exact circle
with his unaided hand.</p></div>

<p>and each man will use his own natural skill.</p>

<p>Wherefore the saying, "Great skill is as
clumsiness."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Extremes meet. These words are attributed to Lao
Tzŭ by Huai Nan Tzŭ, and are incorporated in
ch. xlv of the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Restrain the actions of Tsêng and Shih, stop the
mouths of Yang and Mih, get rid of charity and
duty to one's neighbour,&mdash;and the virtue of the
people will become one with God.</p>

<p>If each man keeps to himself his own sense of
sight, the world will escape confusion. If each
man keeps to himself his own sense of hearing,
the world will escape entanglements. If each man
keeps his knowledge to himself, the world will
escape doubt. If each man keeps his own virtue
to himself, the world will avoid deviation from the
true path.</p>

<p>Tsêng, Shih, Yang, Mih, Shih K'uang, Kung
Ch'ui, and Li Chu, all set up their virtue outside
themselves and involve the world in such angry
discussions that nothing definite is accomplished.</p>

<p>Have you never heard of the Golden Age,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This question must be addressed to the reader.</p></div>

<p>the days of Yung Ch'êng, Ta T'ing, Poh Huang,
Chung Yang, Li Lu, Li Hsü, Hsien Yüan, Hê Hsü,
Tsun Lu, Chu Yung, Fu Hsi, and Shên Nung?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ancient rulers, several of whom have already been
mentioned.</p></div>

<p>Then the people used knotted cords.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As a means of intercommunication. The details of
the system have not, however, come down to us.</p></div>

<p>They were contented with what food and raiment
they could get. They lived simple and peaceful
lives. Neighbouring districts were within sight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and the cocks and dogs of one could be heard in
the other, yet the people grew old and died without
ever interchanging visits.</p>

<p>In those days, government was indeed perfect.
But nowadays any one can excite the people by
saying, "In such and such a place there is a Sage."</p>

<p>Immediately they put together a few provisions
and hurry off, neglecting their parents at home and
their master's business abroad, filing in unbroken
line through territories of Princes, with a string of
carts and carriages a thousand <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i> in length. Such
is the evil effect of an exaggerated desire for knowledge
among our rulers. And if rulers aim at
knowledge and neglect <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, the empire will be
overwhelmed in confusion.</p>

<p>How can it be shown that this is so?&mdash;Bows and
cross-bows and hand-nets and harpoon-arrows,
involve much knowledge in their use; but they
carry confusion among the birds of the air. Hooks
and bait and nets and traps, involve much knowledge
in their use; but they carry confusion among
the fishes of the deep. Fences and nets and snares,
involve much knowledge in their use; but they
carry confusion among the beasts of the field. In
the same way the sophistical fallacies of the hard
and white and the like and the unlike of schoolmen
involve much knowledge of argument; but they
overwhelm the world in doubt.</p>

<p>Therefore it is that whenever there is great
confusion, love of knowledge is ever at the bottom
of it. For all men strive to grasp what they do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
not know, while none strive to grasp what they
already know; and all strive to discredit what they
do not excel in, while none strive to discredit what
they do excel in. The result is overwhelming
confusion.</p>

<p>Thus, above, the splendour of the heavenly
bodies is dimmed; below, the energy of land and
water is disturbed; while midway the influence of
the four seasons is destroyed. There is not one
tiny creature which moves on earth or flies in
air but becomes other than by nature it should be.
So overwhelming is the confusion which desire for
knowledge has brought upon the world ever since
the time of the Three Dynasties downwards!
The simple and the guileless have been set aside;
the specious and the false have been exalted.
Tranquil inaction has given place to a love of
disputation; and by disputation has confusion
come upon the world.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">There</span> has been such a thing as letting
mankind alone; there has never been such
a thing as governing mankind.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>With success.</p></div>

<p>Letting alone springs from fear lest men's
natural dispositions be perverted and their virtue
laid aside. But if their natural dispositions be not
perverted nor their virtue laid aside, what room
is there left for government?</p>

<p>Of old, when Yao governed the empire, he
caused happiness to prevail to excess in man's
nature; and consequently the people were not
satisfied. When Chieh</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See p. <a href="#Page_40">40</a>.</p></div>

<p>governed the empire he caused sorrow to prevail
to excess in man's nature; and consequently the
people were not contented. Dissatisfaction and
discontent are subversive of virtue; and without
virtue there is no such thing for an empire as
stability.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Virtue, here in its ordinary sense.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>When man rejoices greatly he gravitates towards
the positive pole. When he sorrows deeply he
gravitates towards the negative pole.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These "poles" are the male and female principles
already alluded to on p. <a href="#Page_82">82</a>. Originally developed
from the Great Monad, they became the progenitors
of all creation.</p></div>

<p>If the equilibrium of positive and negative</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In nature.</p></div>

<p>is disturbed, the four seasons are interrupted, the
balance of heat and cold is destroyed, and man
himself suffers physically thereby.</p>

<p>Because men are made to rejoice and to sorrow
and to displace their centre of gravity, they lose their
steadiness, and are unsuccessful in thought and
action. And thus it is that the idea of surpassing
others first came into the world, followed by the
appearance of such men as Robber Chê, Tsêng, and
Shih, the result being that the whole world could
not furnish enough rewards for the good nor distribute
punishments enough for the evil among
mankind. And as this great world is not equal to
the demand for rewards and punishments; and as,
ever since the time of the Three Dynasties</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The legendary emperors Fu Hsi, Shên Nung, and

leisure can they have had for adapting themselves
to the natural conditions of their existence?</p>

<p>Besides, over-refinement of vision leads to
debauchery in colour; over-refinement of hearing
leads to debauchery in sound; over-refinement of
charity leads to confusion in virtue;</p>

<p>Here again the manifestation of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. See p. <a href="#Page_45">45</a>.</p></div>

<p>over-refinement of duty towards one's neighbour
leads to perversion of principle;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The eternal principles which are of <span class="smcap">Tao</span> and not of

<p>over-refinement of ceremonial leads to divergence
from the true object; over-refinement of music

extension of vice.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As shown in the preceding chapter.</p></div>

<p>If people adapt themselves to the natural conditions
of existence, the above eight</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Vision, hearing, charity, duty to one's neighbour,
ceremonial, music, wisdom, and shrewdness.</p></div>

<p>may be or may not be; it matters not. But if
people do not adapt themselves to the natural
conditions of existence, then these eight become
hindrances and spoilers, and throw the world into
confusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of this, the world reverences and
cherishes them, thereby greatly increasing the
sum of human error. And not as a passing
fashion, but with admonitions in words, with
humility in prostrations, and with the stimulus
of music and song. What then is left for me?</p>

<p>Therefore, for the perfect man who is unavoidably
summoned to power over his fellows, there is
naught like <em>Inaction</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

should shirk his mortal responsibilities. On the contrary,
<span class="smcap">Tao</span> teaches him how to meet them.</p></div>

<p>By means of inaction he will be able to adapt himself
to the natural conditions of existence. And
so it is that he who respects the State as his own
body is fit to support it, and he who loves the State
as his own body, is fit to govern it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some of this passage is repeated in <a href="#Page_173">ch. xiv</a>.</p></div>

<p>Ts'ui Chü</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A casual personage.</p></div>

<p>asked Lao Tzŭ, saying, "If the empire is not to
be governed, how are men's hearts to be kept in
order?"</p>

<p>"Be careful," replied Lao Tzŭ, "not to interfere
with the natural goodness of the heart of man.
Man's heart may be forced down or stirred up. In
each case the issue is fatal.</p>

<p>"By gentleness, the hardest heart may be
softened. But try to cut and polish it,&mdash;'twill glow
like fire or freeze like ice. In the twinkling of an
eye it will pass beyond the limits of the Four Seas.
In repose, profoundly still; in motion, far away in
the sky. No bolt can bar, no bond can bind,&mdash;such
is the human heart."</p>

<p>"Of old, the Yellow Emperor first caused charity
and duty to one's neighbour to interfere with the
natural goodness of the heart of man. In consequence
of which, Yao and Shun wore the hair
off their legs in endeavouring to feed their people.
They disturbed their internal economy in order to
find room for charity and duty to one's neighbour.
They exhausted their energies in framing laws and
statutes. Still they did not succeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thereupon, Yao confined Huan Tou on Mount
Tsung; drove the chief of San-miao and his people
into San-wei, and kept them there; and banished
the Minister of Works to Yu Island.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<cite>Shu Ching</cite> or Canon of History. They refer to

the times of the Three Princes</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Great Yü, T'ang, and Wên Wang, founder of
the Chou dynasty.</p></div>

<p>the empire was in a state of great unrest. Among
the bad men were Chieh and Chê; among the good
were Tsêng and Shih. By and by, the Confucianists
and the Mihists arose; and then came
exultation and anger of rivals, fraud between the
simple and the cunning, recrimination between the
virtuous and the evil, slander between the honest
and the dishonest,&mdash;until decadence set in, men fell
away from their original virtue, their natures
became corrupt, and there was a general rush for
knowledge.</p>

<p>"The next thing was to coerce by all kinds of
physical torture, thus bringing utter confusion into
the empire, the blame for which rests upon those
who would interfere with the natural goodness of
the heart of man.</p>

<p>"In consequence, virtuous men sought refuge in
mountain caves, while rulers of States sat trembling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in their ancestral halls. Then, when dead men
lay about pillowed on each others' corpses, when
cangued prisoners and condemned criminals jostled
each other in crowds,&mdash;then the Confucianists and
the Mihists, in the midst of gyves and fetters, stood
forth to preach!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Salvation from the ills of which they and their systems
had been the cause.</p></div>

<p>Alas, they know not shame, nor what it is to blush!</p>

<p>"Until I can say that the wisdom of Sages is
not a fastener of cangues, and that charity and

<p>The Yellow Emperor sat on the throne for nineteen
years, and his laws obtained all over the

<p>Said by some commentators to be another name for

<p>was living on Mount K'ung-t'ung, he went thither
to see him, and said, "I am told, Sir, that you are
in possession of perfect <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. May I ask in what
perfect <span class="smcap">Tao</span> consists? I desire to avail myself of
the good influence of heaven and earth in order to
secure harvests and feed my people. I should also

<p>in order to the protection of all living things.
How can I accomplish this?"</p>

<p>"What you desire to avail yourself of," replied
Kuang Ch'êng Tzŭ, "is the primordial integrity of
matter. What you wish to control are the disintegrators
thereof. Ever since the empire has been
<em>governed</em> by you, the clouds have rained without
waiting to thicken, the foliage of trees has fallen
without waiting to grow yellow, the brightness of
the sun and moon has paled, and the voice of the
flatterer is heard on every side. How then speak
of perfect <span class="smcap">Tao</span>?"</p>

<p>The Yellow Emperor withdrew. He resigned
the Throne. He built himself a solitary hut. He
lay upon straw. For three months he remained
in seclusion, and then went again to see Kuang
Ch'êng Tzŭ.</p>

<p>The latter was lying down with his face to the
south. The Yellow Emperor approached after the
manner of an inferior, upon his knees. Prostrating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
himself upon the ground he said, "I am told, Sir,
that you are in possession of perfect <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. May I
ask how my self may be preserved so as to last?"</p>

<p>Kuang Ch'êng Tzŭ jumped up with a start. "A
good question indeed!" cried he. "Come, and I
will speak to you of perfect <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p>

<p>"The essence of perfect <span class="smcap">Tao</span> is profoundly
mysterious; its extent is lost in obscurity.</p>

<p>"See nothing; hear nothing; let your soul be
wrapped in quiet; and your body will begin to take
proper form. Let there be absolute repose and
absolute purity; do not weary your body nor disturb
your vitality,&mdash;and you will live for ever. For
if the eye sees nothing, and the ear hears nothing,
and the mind</p>

<p>Not in the grosser worldly sense, but as a sublimated
unit in eternity.</p></div>

<p>"Cherish that which is within you, and shut off
that which is without; for much knowledge is a
curse. Then I will place you upon that abode of
Great Light which is the source of the positive
Power, and escort you through the gate of Profound
Mystery which is the source of the negative
Power. These Powers are the controllers of heaven

with externals. It is because I have thus
cared for my self now for twelve hundred years
that my body has not decayed."</p>

<p>The Yellow Emperor prostrated himself and
said, "Kuang Ch'êng Tzŭ is surely God...."</p>

<p>Whereupon the latter continued, "Come, I will
tell you. That self is eternal; yet all men think it
mortal. That self is infinite; yet all men think it
finite. Those who possess <span class="smcap">Tao</span> are princes in this
life and rulers in the hereafter. Those who do not
possess <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, behold the light of day in this life

<p>"Nowadays, all living things spring from the dust
and to the dust return. But I will lead you through
the portals of Eternity into the domain of Infinity.

latter was slapping his ribs and hopping about;
whereupon the Spirit of the Clouds said, "Who
are you, old man, and what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Strolling!" replied the Vital Principle, without
stopping.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Activities ceaseless in their imperceptible operation.</p></div>

<p>"I want to <em>know</em> something," continued the
Spirit of the Clouds.</p>

<p>"Ah!" uttered the Vital Principle, in a tone of
disapprobation.</p>

<p>"The relationship of heaven and earth is out of
harmony," said the Spirit of the Clouds; "the six
influences do not combine,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The positive and negative principles, wind, rain,
darkness, and light.</p></div>

<p>and the four seasons are no longer regular. I desire
to blend the six influences so as to nourish all

<p>"I do not know!" cried the Vital Principle,
shaking his head, while still slapping his ribs and
hopping about; "I do not know!"</p>

<p>So the Spirit of the Clouds did not press his
question; but three years later, when passing eastwards
through the Yu-sung territory, he again fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
in with the Vital Principle. The former was overjoyed,
and hurrying up, said, "Has your Holiness
forgotten me?"</p>

<p>He then prostrated himself, and desired to be
allowed to interrogate the Vital Principle; but the
latter said, "I wander on without knowing what I
want. I roam about without knowing where I am
going. I stroll in this ecstatic manner, simply
awaiting events. What should I know?"</p>

<p>"I too roam about," answered the Spirit of the
Clouds; "but the people depend upon my movements.
I am thus unavoidably summoned to
power; and under these circumstances I would
gladly receive some advice."</p>

<p>"That the scheme of empire is in confusion," said
the Vital Principle, "that the conditions of life are
violated, that the will of God does not triumph,
that the beasts of the field are disorganised, that
the birds of the air cry at night, that blight reaches
the trees and herbs, that destruction spreads among
creeping things,&mdash;this, alas! is the fault of
<em>government</em>."</p>

<p>"True," replied the Spirit of the Clouds, "but
what am I to do?"</p>

<p>"It is here," cried the Vital Principle, "that the
poison lurks! Go back!"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To the root, to that natural state in which by inaction
all things are accomplished.</p></div>

<p>"It is not often," urged the Spirit of the Clouds,
"that I meet with your Holiness. I would gladly
receive some advice."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Feed then your people," said the Vital Principle,
"with your heart.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By the influence of your own perfection.</p></div>

<p>Rest in inaction, and the world will be good of
itself. Cast your slough. Spit forth intelligence.
Ignore all differences. Become one with the infinite.
Release your mind. Free your soul. Be vacuous.
Be Nothing!</p>

<p>"Let all things revert to their original constitution.
If they do this, without knowledge, the
result will be a simple purity which they will never
lose; but knowledge will bring with it a divergence
therefrom. Seek not the names nor the relations of
things, and all things will flourish of themselves."</p>

Those who desire to govern kingdoms, clutch at the
advantages of the Three Princes without seeing the
troubles involved. In fact, they trust to luck. But
in thus trusting to luck not to destroy the kingdom,
their chances of preserving it do not amount to one
in ten thousand, while their chances of destroying
it are ten thousand to nothing and even more.
Such, alas! is the ignorance of rulers.</p>

<p>The above somewhat unsatisfactory paragraph condemns
those who strive to distinguish themselves
from, and set themselves up as <em>governors</em> of, their
fellow-men.</p></div>

<p>For, given territory, there is the great thing&mdash;Man.
Given man, he must not be managed as if
he were a mere thing; though by not managing him
at all he may actually be managed as if he were a
mere thing. And for those who understand that
the management of man as if he were a mere thing
is not the way to manage him, the issue is not confined
to mere government of the empire. Such men
may wander at will between the six limits of space or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
travel over the continent of earth, unrestrained in
coming and in going. This is to be distinguished
from one's fellows, and this distinction is the
highest attainable by man.</p>

<p>The doctrine of the perfect man is to him as
shadow to form, as echo to sound. Ask and it
responds, fulfilling its mission as the help-mate of
humanity. Noiseless in repose, objectless in
motion, it guides you to the goal, free to come and
free to go for ever without end. Alone in its exits
and its entrances, it rivals the eternity of the sun.</p>

<p>As for his body, that is in accordance with the
usual standard. Being in accordance with the usual
standard it is not distinguished in any way. But if
not distinguished in any way, what becomes of the
distinction by which he is distinguished?</p>

<p>Those who see what is to be seen,&mdash;of such were
the perfect men of old. Those who see what is not

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In inaction there is action.</p></div>

<p>Therefore the true Sage looks up to God, but
does not offer to aid. He perfects his virtue, but
does not involve himself. He guides himself by
Tao, but makes no plans. He identifies himself
with charity, but does not rely on it. He extends
to duty towards his neighbour, but does not store it
up. He responds to ceremony, without tabooing it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Although really recognising only the ceremony of
the heart which requires no outward sign.</p></div>

<p>He undertakes affairs without declining them. He
metes out law without confusion. He relies on his
fellow-men and does not make light of them. He
accommodates himself to matter and does not
ignore it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thus the action of the Sage is after all inaction.</p></div>

<p>While there should be no action, there should be
also no inaction.</p>

<p>What then is <span class="smcap">Tao</span>?&mdash;There is the <span class="smcap">Tao</span> of God,

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The term here used has been elsewhere rendered

God and man, while <span class="smcap">Tao</span> spread throughout all
creation. Men were controlled by outward circumstances,
applying their in-born skill to the development
of civilised life. This skill was bound up
with the circumstances of life, and these with duty,
and duty with virtue, and virtue with <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Tao</span> with God.</p>

<p>Therefore it has been said, "As for those who
nourished the empire of old, having no desires for
themselves, the empire was not in want. They did
nothing, and all things proceeded on their course.
They preserved a dignified repose, and the people
rested in peace."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We are not told who said these words. They are
not in the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>; and yet if Lao Tzŭ did
not utter them, it is difficult to say who did.</p></div>

<p>The <em>Record</em> says, "By converging to <span class="smcap">One</span>, all
things may be accomplished. By the virtue which
is without intention, even the supernatural may be
subdued."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>How much more <em>man</em>? Kuo Hsiang says the
<em>Record</em> was the name of a work ascribed to Lao
Tzŭ.</p></div>

<p>The Master said, "<span class="smcap">Tao</span> covers and supports all
things,"&mdash;so vast is its extent. Each man should
prepare his heart accordingly.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This "Master" has been identified with both
Chuang Tzŭ and Lao Tzŭ.</p></div>

<p>"To act by means of inaction is God. To speak
by means of inaction is Virtue. To love men and
care for things is Charity. To recognise the unlike
as the like is breadth of view. To make no distinctions
is liberal. To possess variety is wealth. And
so, to hold fast to virtue is strength. To complete
virtue is establishment. To follow <span class="smcap">Tao</span> is to be
prepared. And not to run counter to the natural
bias of things is to be perfect.</p>

<p>"He who fully realises these ten points, by storing
them within enlarges his heart, and with this
enlargement brings all creation to himself. Such a
man will bury gold on the hillside and cast pearls
into the sea. He will not struggle for wealth, nor
strive for fame. He will not rejoice at old age, nor
grieve over early death. He will find no pleasure
in success, no chagrin in failure. He will not
account a throne as his own private gain, nor the
empire of the world as glory personal to himself.
His glory is to know that all things are <span class="smcap">One</span>, and
that life and death are but phases of the same
existence!"</p>

<p>The Master said, "How profound in its repose,
how infinite in its purity, is <span class="smcap">Tao</span>!</p>

<p>"If metal and stone were without <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, they
would not be capable of emitting sound. And
just as they possess the property of sound but will

<p>"The man of complete virtue remains blankly
passive as regards what goes on around him. He
is as originally by nature, and his knowledge
extends to the supernatural. Thus, his virtue
expands his heart, which goes forth to all who
come to take refuge therein.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His heart does not initiate the movement, but
simply responds to an influence brought to bear.</p></div>

<p>"Without <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, form cannot be endued with
life. Without virtue, life cannot be endued with
intelligence. To preserve one's form, live out one's
life, establish one's virtue, and realise <span class="smcap">Tao</span>,&mdash;is not

<p>Yao's tutor was Hsü Yu. The latter's tutor was
Yeh Ch'üeh, and Yeh Ch'üeh's tutor was Wang I,

<p>Yao enquired of Hsü Yu, saying, "Would Yeh
Ch'üeh do to be emperor? I am going to get
Wang I to ask him."</p>

<p>"Alas!" cried Hsü Yu, "that would be bad
indeed for the empire. Yeh Ch'üeh is a clever and
capable man. He is by nature better than most
men, but he seeks by means of the human to reach
the divine. He strives to do no wrong; but he is
ignorant of the source from which wrong springs.
Emperor forsooth! He avails himself of the
artificial and neglects the natural. He lacks unity
in himself. He worships intelligence and is always
in a state of ferment. He is a slave to circumstances

<p>Yao went to visit Hua. The border-warden of
Hua said "Ha! a Sage. My best respects to
you, Sir. I wish you a long life."</p>

<p>"Don't!" replied Yao.</p>

<p>"I wish you plenty of money," continued the
border-warden.</p>

<p>"Don't!" replied Yao.</p>

<p>"And many sons," added he.</p>

<p>"Don't!" replied Yao.</p>

<p>"Long life, plenty of money, and many sons,"
cried the warden, "these are what all men desire.
How is it you alone do not want them?"</p>

<p>"Many sons," answered Yao, "are many
anxieties. Plenty of money means plenty of
trouble. Long life involves much that is not
pleasant to put up with. These three gifts do not
advance virtue; therefore I declined them."</p>

<p>"At first I took you for a Sage," said the
warden, "but now I find you are a mere man.
God, in sending man into the world, gives to each
his proper function. If you have many sons and
give to each his proper function, what cause have
you for anxiety?</p>

<p>"And similarly, if you have wealth and allow
others to share it, what troubles will you have?"</p>

<p>"The true Sage dwells like the quail</p>

If there be <span class="smcap">Tao</span> in the empire, he and all things
are in harmony. If there be not <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, he cultivates
virtue in retirement. After a thousand years
of this weary world, he mounts aloft, and riding
upon the white clouds passes into the kingdom of
God, whither the three evils do not reach, and
where he rests secure in eternity. What is there
to put up with in that?"</p>

<p>Thereupon the border-warden went off, and Yao
followed him; saying, "May I ask&mdash;&mdash;," to which
the warden only replied "Begone!"</p>

<p>When Yao was Emperor, Poh Ch'êng Tzŭ Kao</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lao Tzŭ under a previous incarnation. See the
Kuang Ch'êng Tzŭ of p. 125.</p></div>

<p>was one of his vassals. But when Yao handed
over the empire to Shun, and Shun to the Great
Yü, Poh Ch'êng Tzŭ Kao resigned his fief and
betook himself to agriculture.</p>

<p>The Great Yü going to visit him, found him
working in the fields; whereupon he approached
humbly, saying, "When Yao was emperor, you,
Sir, were a vassal; but when Yao handed over the
empire to Shun, and Shun to me, you resigned
your fief and betook yourself to agriculture. May
I enquire the reason of this?"</p>

<p>"When Yao ruled the empire," said Tzŭ Kao,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
"the people exerted themselves without reward
and behaved themselves without punishment.
But now you reward and punish them, and yet
they are not good. From this point virtue will
decline, the reign of force will begin, and the
troubles of after ages will date their rise. Away
with you! Do not interrupt my work." And he
quietly went on ploughing as before.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The above episode is unmistakably spurious.</p></div>

<p>At the beginning of the beginning, even Nothing
did not exist. Then came the period of the
Nameless.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Nameless," says the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>, ch. i,
"was the beginning of heaven and earth." See
also <a href="#Page_12">ch. ii</a>, <em>ante</em>.</p></div>

<p>When <span class="smcap">One</span> came into existence, there was <span class="smcap">One</span>,
but it was formless. When things got that by
which they came into existence, it was called their
<em>virtue</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Sc.</i> that, by virtue of which they are what they are.

<p>though without interstice,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Unbroken in continuity.</p></div>

<p>was called <em>destiny</em>.</p>

<p>Then came the movement which gave life, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
things produced in accordance with the principles
of life had what is called <em>form</em>. When form
encloses the spiritual part, each with its own
characteristics, that is its <em>nature</em>. By cultivating
this nature, we are carried back to virtue; and if
this is perfected, we become as all things were in
the beginning. We become unconditioned, and
the unconditioned is great. As birds join their
beaks in chirping,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Unconsciously.</p></div>

<p>and beaks to chirp must be joined,&mdash;to be thus
joined with the universe without being more conscious
of it than an idiot, this is <em>divine virtue</em>,
this is accordance with the eternal fitness of
things.</p>

<p>Confucius asked Lao Tzŭ, saying, "There are

whiteness as though these could be hung up on
different pegs.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See p. <a href="#Page_22">22</a>.</p></div>

<p>Could such persons be termed sages?"</p>

<p>"That," replied Lao Tzŭ, "is but the skill of
the handicraftsman, wearing out body and soul
alike. The powers of the hunting-dog involve it
in trouble;</p>

<p>Chiang Lü Mien went to see Chi Ch'ê,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Two obscure personages.</p></div>

<p>and said, "The Prince of Lu begged me to instruct
him, but I declined. However, he would take no
refusal, so I was obliged to do so. I don't know if
I was correct in my doctrine or not. Please note
what I said. I told him to be decorous and thrifty;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
to advance the public-spirited and loyal, and to have
no partialities. Then, I said, no one would venture
to oppose him."</p>

<p>Chi Ch'ê sniggered and said, "Your remarks on
the virtues of Princes may be compared with the
mantis stretching out its feelers and trying to
stop a carriage,&mdash;not likely to effect the object
proposed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Alas! I fear I am but a fool," replied Chiang
Lü Mien. "Nevertheless, I should be glad to be
instructed by you in the proper course to pursue."</p>

<p>"The government of the perfect Sage," explained
Chi Ch'ê, "consists in influencing the hearts of the
people so as to cause them to complete their
education, to reform their manners, to subdue the
rebel mind, and to exert themselves one and all for
the common good. This influence operates in
accordance with the natural disposition of the
people, who are thus unconscious of its operation.
He who can so act has no need to humble himself
before the teachings of Yao and Shun. He makes
the desires of the people coincident with virtue,
and their hearts rest therein."</p>

<p>When Tzŭ Kung</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See <a href="#Page_68">ch. vi</a>.</p></div>

<p>went south to the Ch'u State on his way back to
the Chin State, he passed through Han-yin. There
he saw an old man engaged in making a ditch to
connect his vegetable garden with a well. He had
a pitcher in his hand, with which he was bringing
up water and pouring it into the ditch,&mdash;great
labour with very little result.</p>

<p>"If you had a machine here," cried Tzŭ Kung,
"in a day you could irrigate a hundred times your
present area. The labour required is trifling as
compared with the work done. Would you not
like to have one?"</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the gardener.</p>

<p>"It is a contrivance made of wood," replied Tzŭ
Kung, "heavy behind and light in front. It draws
up water as you do with your hands, but in a constantly
overflowing stream. It is called a well-sweep."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Still used all over China.</p></div>

<p>Thereupon the gardener flushed up and said, "I
have heard from my teacher that those who have
cunning implements are cunning in their dealings,
and that those who are cunning in their dealings
have cunning in their hearts, and that those who
have cunning in their hearts cannot be pure and
incorrupt, and that those who are not pure and
incorrupt are restless in spirit, and that those who
are restless in spirit are not fit vehicles for <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
It is not that I do not know of these things. I
should be ashamed to use them."</p>

<p>At this Tzŭ Kung was much abashed, and said
nothing. Then the gardener asked him who he
was, to which Tzŭ Kung replied that he was a
disciple of Confucius.</p>

<p>"Are you not one who extends his learning with
a view to being a Sage; who talks big in order to
put himself above the rest of mankind; who plays
in a key to which no one can sing so as to spread
his reputation abroad? Rather become unconscious
of self and shake off the trammels of the
flesh,&mdash;and you will be near. But if you cannot
govern your own self, what leisure have you for
governing the empire? Begone! Do not interrupt
my work."</p>

<p>Tzŭ Kung changed colour and slunk away, being
not at all pleased with this rebuff; and it was not
before he had travelled some thirty <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i> that he
recovered his usual appearance.</p>

<p>"What did the man we met do," asked a disciple,
"that you should change colour and not
recover for such a long time?"</p>

<p>"I used to think there was only one man in all
the world," replied Tzŭ Kung.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Meaning Confucius.</p></div>

<p>"I did not know that there was also this man.
I have heard the Master say that the test of a
scheme is its practicability, and that success
must be certain. The minimum of effort with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the maximum of success,&mdash;such is the way of the
Sage.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The absurdity of attributing such doctrines to Confucius
will be apparent to every student of the Sage's
remains.</p></div>

<p>"Not so this manner of man. Aiming at <span class="smcap">Tao</span>,
he perfects his virtue. By perfecting his virtue
he perfects his body, and by perfecting his body
he perfects his spiritual part. And the perfection
of the spiritual part is the <span class="smcap">Tao</span> of the Sage.
Coming into life he is as one of the people, knowing
not whither he is bound. How complete is his
purity? Success, profit, skill,&mdash;these have no place
in his heart. Such a man, if he does not will it, he
does not stir; if he does not wish it, he does not
act. If all the world praises him, he does not
heed. If all the world blames him, he does not
repine.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Reminding us of the philosopher Yung of <a href="#Page_1">ch. i</a>.</p></div>

<p>The praise and the blame of the world neither
advantage him nor otherwise. He may be called a
man of perfect virtue. As for me, I am but a mere
creature of impulse."</p>

<p>So he went back to Lu to tell Confucius. But
Confucius said, "That fellow pretends to a knowledge
of the science of the ante-mundane. He
knows something, but not much. His government
is of the internal, not of the external. What is
there wonderful in a man by clearness of intelligence
becoming pure, by inaction reverting to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
original integrity, and with his nature and his
spiritual part wrapped up in a body, passing
through this common world of ours? Besides, to
you and to me the science of the ante-mundane is
not worth knowing."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is only the present which concerns man.</p>

<p>This last is an utterance which might well have
fallen from the lips of Confucius. But the whole
episode is clearly an interpolation of later times.</p></div>

Chun Mang. "The officials confine themselves
to their functions. Ability is secure of employment.
The voice of the people is heard, and action

their own affairs, and so the empire is at peace. A

<p>"Tell me about the man of perfect virtue," said
Yüan Fêng.</p>

<p>"The man of perfect virtue," replied Chun
Mang, "in repose has no thoughts, in action no
anxiety. He recognises no right, nor wrong, nor
good, nor bad. Within the Four Seas, when all
profit&mdash;that is his pleasure; when all share&mdash;that
is his repose. Men cling to him as children who
have lost their mothers; they rally round him as
wayfarers who have missed their road. He has
wealth and to spare, but he knows not whence it
comes. He has food and drink more than sufficient,
but knows not who provides it. Such is a
man of virtue."</p>

<p>"And now," said Yüan Fêng, "tell me about
the divine man."</p>

<p>"The divine man," replied Chun Mang, "rides
upon the glory of the sky where his form can no

light. He fulfils his destiny. He acts in accordance
with his nature. He is at one with God and
man. For him all affairs cease to exist, and all

cure his loving father.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Because to need drugs, the father must first have
been sick; and this, from a Chinese point of view,
is clearly the fault of the son.</p></div>

<p>"In the Golden Age, good men were not appreciated;
ability was not conspicuous. Rulers were
mere beacons, while the people were free as the
wild deer. They were upright without being
conscious of duty to their neighbours. They loved
one another without being conscious of charity.
They were true without being conscious of loyalty.
They were honest without being conscious of good
faith. They acted freely in all things without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
recognising obligations to any one. Thus, their
deeds left no trace; their affairs were not handed
down to posterity.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Rousseau, in <cite>Du Contrat Social</cite>, thus describes
society as it would be if every man was a true
Christian:&mdash;"Chacun remplirait son devoir; le peuple
serait soumis aux lois, les chefs seraient justes et
modérés, les magistrats intègres, incorruptibles, les
soldats mépriseraient la mort, il n'y aurait ni vanité
ni luxe."</p></div>

<p>"A filial son does not humour his parents. A
loyal minister does not flatter his prince. This is
the acme of filial piety and loyalty. To assent to
whatever a parent or a prince says, and to praise
whatever a parent or a prince does, this is what the
world calls unfilial and disloyal conduct, though
apparently unaware that the principle is of universal
application. For though a man assents to
whatever the world says, and praises whatever the
world does, he is not dubbed a toady; from which
one might infer that the world is severer than a
father and more to be respected than a prince!</p>

<p>"If you tell a man he is a wheedler, he will not
like it. If you tell him he is a flatterer, he will be
angry. Yet he is everlastingly both. But all such
sham and pretence is what the world likes, and
consequently people do not punish each other for
doing what they do themselves. For a man to
arrange his dress, or make a display, or suit his
expression so as to get into the good graces of the
world, and yet not to call himself a flatterer; to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
identify himself in every way with the yeas and
nays of his fellows, and yet not call himself one of
them;&mdash;this is the height of folly.</p>

<p>"A man who knows that he is a fool is not a
great fool. A man who knows his error is not
greatly in error. Great error can never be shaken
off; a great fool never becomes clear-headed. If
three men are travelling and one man makes a
mistake, they may still arrive at their destination,
error being in the minority. But if two of them
make a mistake, then they will not succeed, error
being in the majority. And now, as all the world
is in error, I, though I know the true path, am
alas! unable to guide.</p>

<p>"Grand music does not appeal to vulgar ears.
Give them the <em>Chê-yang</em> or the <em>Huang-hua</em>,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

ancient China.</p></div>

<p>and they will roar with laughter. And likewise
great truths do not take hold of the hearts of the
masses. And great truths not finding utterance,
common-places carry the day. Two earthen instruments
will drown the sound of one metal one;
and the result will not be melodious.</p>

<p>"And now, as all the world is in error, I, though
I know the true path,&mdash;how shall I guide? If I
know that I cannot succeed and yet try to force
success, this would be but another source of error.
Better, then, to desist and strive no more. But if
I strive not, who will?</p>

The stump remains in a ditch. The sacrificial

nature is concerned. Similarly, the acts of Robber
Chê and of Tsêng and Shih are very different; but
the loss of original nature is in each case the same.</p>

<p>"The causes of this loss are five in number;
viz.&mdash;The five colours confuse the eye, and the eyes
fail to see clearly. The five sounds confuse the
ear, and the ear fails to hear accurately. The five
scents confuse the nose, and obstruct the sense of
smell. The five tastes cloy the palate, and vitiate
the sense of taste. Finally, likes and dislikes cloud
the understanding, and cause dispersion of the

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">The Tao of God.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Argument</i>:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tao</span> is repose&mdash;Repose the secret of the universe&mdash;Cultivation
of essentials&mdash;Neglect of accidentals&mdash;The sequence of
<span class="smcap">Tao</span>&mdash;Spontaneity of true virtue&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tao</span> is unconditioned&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tao</span>
cannot be conveyed&mdash;Illustrations.</p></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> <span class="smcap">Tao</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span> operates ceaselessly; and all
things are produced. The <span class="smcap">Tao</span> of the sovereign
operates ceaselessly; and the empire rallies around
him. The <span class="smcap">Tao</span> of the Sage operates ceaselessly;
and all within the limit of surrounding ocean acknowledge
his sway. He who apprehends God, who
is in relation with the Sage, and who recognises the
radiating virtue of the sovereign,&mdash;his actions will
be to him unconscious, the actions of repose.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>With him all will be inaction, by which all things
will be accomplished.</p></div>

<p>The repose of the Sage is not what the world calls
repose. His repose is the result of his mental attitude.
All creation could not disturb his equilibrium:
hence his repose.</p>

<p>When water is still, it is like a mirror, reflecting
the beard and the eyebrows. It gives the accuracy
of the water-level, and the philosopher makes it his
model. And if water thus derives lucidity from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
stillness, how much more the faculties of the mind?
The mind of the Sage being in repose becomes
the mirror of the universe, the speculum of all
creation.</p>

<p>Repose, tranquillity, stillness, inaction,&mdash;these
were the levels of the universe, the ultimate perfection
of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the early days of Time, ere matter had assumed
shape, it was by such levels that the spiritual was
adjusted.</p></div>

<p>Therefore wise rulers and Sages rest therein.
Resting therein they reach the unconditioned,
from which springs the conditioned; and with
the conditioned comes order.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Meaning those laws which are inseparable from
concrete existences.</p></div>

<p>Again, from the unconditioned comes repose, and
from repose comes movement,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When once inner repose has been established, outer
movement results as a matter of necessity, without
injury to the organism.</p></div>

<p>and from movement comes attainment. Further,
from repose comes inaction, and from inaction comes
potentiality of action.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When inaction has been achieved, action results
spontaneously and unconsciously to the organism.</p></div>

<p>And inaction is happiness; and where there is
happiness no cares can abide, and life is long.</p>

<p>Repose, tranquillity, stillness, inaction,&mdash;these
were the source of all things. Due perception of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
this was the secret of Yao's success as a ruler, and
of Shun's success as his minister. Due perception
of this constitutes the virtue of sovereigns on the
throne, the <span class="smcap">Tao</span> of the inspired Sage and of the
uncrowned King below. Keep to this in retirement,
and the lettered denizens of sea and dale will
recognise your power. Keep to this when coming
forward to pacify a troubled world, and your merit
shall be great and your name illustrious, and the
empire united into one. In your repose you will be
wise; in your movements, powerful. By inaction
you will gain honour; and by confining yourself to
the pure and simple, you will hinder the whole
world from struggling with you for show.</p>

<p>To fully apprehend the scheme of the universe,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Lit.</i>: "the virtue of heaven and earth," meaning
their inaction by which all things are brought to
maturity.</p></div>

<p>this is called the great secret of being in accord with
<span class="smcap">God</span>, whereby the empire is so administered that
the result is accord with man. To be in accord
with man is human happiness; to be in accord with
God is the happiness of God.</p>

<p>Chuang Tzŭ said, "O my exemplar! Thou who
destroyest all things, and dost not account it cruelty;
thou who benefitest all time, and dost not account
it charity; thou who art older than antiquity and
dost not account it age; thou who supportest the
universe, shaping the many forms therein, and
dost not account it skill;&mdash;this is the happiness of
God!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore it has been said, "Those who enjoy
the happiness of God, when born into the world,
are but fulfilling their divine functions; when they
die, they do but undergo a physical change. In
repose, they exert the influence of the Negative; in
motion, they wield the power of the Positive."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See <i>ante</i>, chs. <a href="#Page_68">vi</a> and <a href="#Page_119">xi</a>.</p></div>

<p>Thus, those who enjoy the happiness of God
have no grievance against God, no grudge against
man. Nothing material injures them; nothing
spiritual punishes them. Accordingly it has been
said, "Their motion is that of heaven;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One of ceaseless revolution, without beginning or
end.</p></div>

<p>their repose is that of earth. Mental equilibrium
gives them the empire of the world. Evil spirits
do not harass them without; demons do not trouble
them within. Mental equilibrium gives them sovereignty
over all creation." Which signifies that in
repose to extend to the whole universe and to be in
relation with all creation,&mdash;this is the happiness of
God. This enables the mind of the Sage to cherish
the whole empire.</p>

<p>For the virtue of the wise ruler is modelled upon
the universe, is guided by <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, and is ever occupied
in inaction. By inaction, he administers the empire,
and has energy to spare; but by action he
finds his energy inadequate to the administration of
the empire. Therefore the men of old set great
store by inaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>But if rulers practise inaction and the ruled also
practise inaction, the ruled will equal the rulers,
and will not be as their subjects. On the other
hand, if the ruled practise action and rulers also
practise action, rulers will assimilate themselves to
the ruled, and will not be as their masters.
Rulers must practise inaction in order to administer
the empire. The ruled must practise action in
order to subserve the interests of the empire. This
is an unchangeable law.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And one over which the commentators have exhausted
not a little wit. At the end of the chapter,
the reader will be able to draw his own conclusions.</p></div>

<p>Thus, the men of old, although their knowledge
did not extend throughout the universe, were not
troubled in mind. Although their intellectual
powers beautified all creation, they did not rejoice.
Although their abilities exhausted all things within
the limits of ocean, they did not act.</p>

<p>Heaven has no parturitions, yet all things are
evolved. Earth knows no increment, yet all things
are nourished. The wise ruler practises inaction,
and the empire applauds him. Therefore it has
been said, "There is nothing more mysterious</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In its action.</p></div>

<p>than heaven, nothing richer than earth, nothing
greater than the wise ruler." Wherefore also it has
been said, "The virtue of the wise ruler makes him
the peer of heaven and earth." Charioted upon the
universe, with all creation for his team, he passes
along the highway of mortality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>The essential is in the ruler; the accidental in
the ruled.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Lit.</i> the "root," and the "tip" of the branch,
respectively.</p></div>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultima ratio</i> lies with the prince; representation
is the duty of the minister.</p>

<p>Appeal to arms is the lowest form of virtue.
Rewards and punishments are the lowest form of
education. Ceremonies and laws are the lowest
form of government. Music and fine clothes are
the lowest form of happiness. Weeping and
mourning are the lowest form of grief. These five
should follow the movements of the mind.</p>

<p>The ancients indeed cultivated the study of accidentals,
but they did not allow it to precede that
of essentials. The prince precedes, the minister
follows. The father precedes, the son follows. The
elder brother precedes, the younger follows. Seniors
precede, juniors follow. Men precede, women
follow. Husbands precede, wives follow. Distinctions
of rank and precedence are part of the scheme
of the universe, and the Sage adopts them accordingly.
In point of spirituality, heaven is honourable,
earth is lowly. Spring and summer precede autumn
and winter: such is the order of the seasons. In
the constant production of all things, there are
phases of existence. There are the extremes of
maturity and decay, the perpetual tide of change.
And if heaven and earth, divinest of all, admit of
rank and precedence, how much more man?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>In the ancestral temple, parents rank before all;
at court, the most honourable; in the village, the
elders; in matters to be accomplished, the most
trustworthy. Such is the order which appertains
to <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. He who in considering <span class="smcap">Tao</span> disregards
this order, thereby disregards <span class="smcap">Tao</span>; and he who in
considering <span class="smcap">Tao</span> disregards <span class="smcap">Tao</span>,&mdash;whence will he
secure <span class="smcap">Tao</span>?</p>

<p>Therefore, those of old who apprehended <span class="smcap">Tao</span>,
first apprehended God. <span class="smcap">Tao</span> came next, and then
charity and duty to one's neighbour, and then the
functions of public life, and then forms and names,
and then employment according to capacity, and
then distinctions of good and bad, and then discrimination
between right and wrong, and then
rewards and punishments. Thus wise men and
fools met with their dues; the exalted and the
humble occupied their proper places. And the
virtuous and the worthless being each guided by
their own natural instincts, it was necessary to distinguish
capabilities, and to adopt a corresponding
nomenclature, in order to serve the ruler, nourish
the ruled, administer things generally, and elevate
self. Where knowledge and plans are of no avail,
one must fall back upon the natural. This is perfect
peace, the acme of good government. Therefore it
has been written, "Wherever there is form, there
is also its name." Forms and names indeed
the ancients had, but did not give precedence to
them.</p>

<p>Thus, those of old who considered <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
through five phases before forms and names were
reached, and nine before rewards and punishments
could be discussed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As given in the preceding paragraph.</p></div>

<p>To rise <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per saltum</i> to forms and names is to be
ignorant of their source; to rise <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per saltum</i> to
rewards and punishments is to be ignorant of their
beginning. Those who invert the process of discussing
<span class="smcap">Tao</span>, arguing in a directly contrary sense,
are rather to be governed by others than able to
govern others themselves.</p>

<p>To rise <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per saltum</i> to forms and names and
rewards and punishments, this is to understand the
instrumental part of government, but not to understand
the great principle of government.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Which is <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p></div>

<p>This is to be of use in the administration of the
empire, but not to be able to administer the empire.
This is to be a sciolist, a man of narrow
views.</p>

<p>Ceremonies and laws were indeed cultivated by
the ancients; but they were employed in the service
of the rulers by the ruled. Rulers did not employ
them as a means of nourishing the ruled.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From the beginning of this chapter, the argument
has been eminently unsatisfactory.</p></div>

<p>Of old, Shun asked Yao, saying, "How does
your Majesty employ your faculties?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am not arrogant towards the defenceless,"
replied Yao. "I do not neglect the poor. I grieve
for those who die. I pity the orphan. I sympathise
with the widow. Beyond this, nothing."</p>

<p>"Good indeed!" cried Shun, "but yet not
great."</p>

<p>"How so?" inquired Yao.</p>

<p>"Be passive," said Shun, "like the virtue of
God. The sun and moon shine; the four seasons
revolve; day and night alternate; clouds come and
rain falls."</p>

<p>"Alas!" cried Yao, "what a muddle I have been
making. You are in accord with God; I am in
accord with man."</p>

<p>Of old, heaven and earth were considered great;
and the Yellow Emperor and Yao and Shun all
thought them perfection. Consequently, what did
those do who ruled the empire of old? They did
what heaven and earth do; no more.</p>

advisable to go and interview him."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Confucius; and he thereupon
went to see Lao Tzŭ. The latter would not hear
of the proposal; so Confucius began to expound
the doctrines of his twelve canons, in order to
convince Lao Tzŭ.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"This is all nonsense," cried Lao Tzŭ, interrupting
him. "Tell me what are your criteria."</p>

<p>"Charity," replied Confucius, "and duty towards
one's neighbour."</p>

<p>"Tell me, please," asked Lao Tzŭ, "are these
part of man's original nature?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The question of an innate moral sense early occupied
the attention of Chinese thinkers.</p></div>

<p>"They are," answered Confucius. "Without

be of no effect. These two belong to the original
nature of a pure man. What further would you
have?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me," said Lao Tzŭ, "in what consist
charity and duty to one's neighbour?"</p>

<p>"They consist," answered Confucius, "in a
capacity for rejoicing in all things; in universal
love, without the element of self. These are the
characteristics of charity and duty to one's neighbour."</p>

<p>"What stuff!" cried Lao Tzŭ. "Does not
universal love contradict itself?</p>

birds and beasts, they flock together without varying;
there are trees and shrubs, they grow upwards
without exception, Be like these; follow

vain struggles after charity and duty to one's
neighbour, as though beating a drum in search of

<p>visited Lao Tzŭ, and addressed him, saying,
"Having heard, Sir, that you were a Sage, I put
aside all thought of distance to come and visit
you. Travelling many stages, the soles of my feet
thickened, but I did not venture to rest. And now
I see you are not a Sage. While rats feasted off
your leavings, you turned your sister out of doors.
This is not charity. Though you have no lack of
food, raw and cooked, you are stingy beyond all
bounds."</p>

<p>At this Lao Tzŭ was silent and made no reply;
and the next day Shih Ch'êng Ch'i came again and
said, "Before, I was rude to you; now, I am sorry.
How is this?"</p>

<p>"I have no pretension," replied Lao Tzŭ, "to be
possessed of cunning knowledge nor of divine
wisdom. Had you yesterday called me an ox, I
should have considered myself an ox. Had you
called me a horse, I should have considered myself
a horse.</p>

the reproach. My humility is natural humility.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he advanced again, also respectfully, and
said, "May I ask you about personal cultivation?"</p>

<p>Lao Tzŭ said, "Your countenance is a strange
one. Your eyes protrude. Your jaws are heavy.
Your lips are parted. Your demeanour is self-satisfied.
You look like a man on a tethered
horse.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His body there, his mind elsewhere.</p></div>

<p>You are too confident. You are too hasty. You
think too much of your own powers. Such men are
not trusted. Those who are found on the wrong
side of a boundary line are called thieves."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lao Tzŭ said, "<span class="smcap">Tao</span> is not too small for the
greatest, nor too great for the smallest. Thus all
things are embosomed therein; wide indeed its
boundless capacity, unfathomable its depth.</p>

<p>"Form, and virtue, and charity, and duty to
one's neighbour, these are the accidentals of the
spiritual. Except he be a perfect man, who shall
determine their place? The world of the perfect
man, is not that vast? And yet it is not able to
involve him in trouble. All struggle for power,
but he does not join. Though discovering nothing
false, he is not tempted astray. In spite of the
utmost genuineness, he still confines himself to
essentials.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To the root, not to the branch.</p></div>

<p>"He thus places himself outside the universe,
beyond all creation, where his soul is free from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
care. Apprehending <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, he is in accord with
virtue. He leaves charity and duty to one's
neighbour alone. He treats ceremonies and music
as adventitious. And so the mind of the perfect
man is at peace.</p>

<p>"Books are what the world values as representing
<span class="smcap">Tao</span>. But books are only words, and the valuable
part of words is the thought therein contained.
That thought has a certain bias which cannot be
conveyed in words, yet the world values words as
being the essence of books. But though the world
values them, they are not of value; as that sense
in which the world values them is not the sense in
which they are valuable.</p>

<p>"That which can be seen with the eye is form
and colour; that which can be heard with the ear
is sound and noise. But alas! the people of this
generation think that form, and colour, and sound,
and noise, are means by which they can come to
understand the essence of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. This is not so.
And as those who know, do not speak, while those
who speak do not know, whence should the world
derive its knowledge?"</p>

<p>Below the covered dais, termed "hall," which has

might be carried on.</p></div>

<p>flung down his hammer and chisel, and mounting
the steps said, "What words may your Highness
be studying?"</p>

<p>"I am studying the words of the Sages," replied
the Duke.</p>

<p>"Are the Sages alive?" asked the wheelwright.</p>

<p>"No," answered the Duke; "they are dead."</p>

<p>"Then the words your Highness is studying,"
rejoined the wheelwright, "are only the dregs of
the ancients."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, sirrah!" cried the Duke,
"by interfering with what I read? Explain yourself,
or you shall die."</p>

<p>"Let me take an illustration," said the wheelwright,
"from my own trade. In making a wheel,
if you work too slowly, you can't make it firm; if
you work too fast, the spokes won't fit in. You
must go neither too slowly nor too fast. There
must be co-ordination of mind and hand. Words
cannot explain what it is, but there is some mysterious
art herein. I cannot teach it to my son;
nor can he learn it from me. Consequently,
though seventy years of age, I am still making
wheels in my old age. If the ancients, together
with what they could not impart, are dead and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
gone, then what your Highness is studying must
be the dregs."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This episode of the wheelwright is to be found in
the works of Huai Nan Tzŭ, of the 2nd century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
He used it to illustrate the opening words of the
<cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>; and in <cite>The Remains of Lao Tzŭ</cite>,
p. 6, it is stated that he stole it from Chuang Tzŭ
without acknowledgment.</p>

<p>When that statement was made I had not come to
the conclusion, now forced upon me, that the above
chapter is not from the hand of Chuang Tzŭ. As
one critic remarks, the style is generally admirable;
but it is not the style of Chuang Tzŭ.</p></div>

<p>his rule will be a success and his virtue complete;
he will watch over the interests of his people, and
all the empire will owe him gratitude. This is to
be an eminent ruler."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A very round answer," says Lin Hsi Chung, "to
a very square question."</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tang, a high official of Sung, asked Chuang Tzŭ
about charity. Chuang Tzŭ said, "Tigers and
wolves have it."</p>

<p>"How so?" asked Tang.</p>

<p>"The natural love between parents and offspring,"
replied Chuang Tzŭ,&mdash;"is not that charity?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Tang then inquired about perfect charity.</p>

<p>"Perfect charity," said Chuang Tzŭ, "does not
admit of love for the individual."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It embraces all men equally. To love one person
would imply at least the possibility of hating another.
See also p. <a href="#Page_167">167</a>, where Lao Tzŭ refutes the doctrine
of universal love.</p></div>

<p>"Without such love," replied Tang, "it appears
to me there would be no such thing as affection,
and without affection no filial piety. Does perfect
charity not admit of filial piety?"</p>

<p>"Not so," said Chuang Tzŭ. "Perfect charity
is the more extensive term. Consequently, it was
unnecessary to mention filial piety. It was not
that filial piety was omitted. It was merely not
particularised.</p>

<p>"A man who travels southwards to Ying,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Capital of the Ch'u State.</p></div>

<p>cannot see Mount Ming in the north. Why?
Because he is too far off.</p>

<p>"Therefore it has been said that it is easy to be
respectfully filial, but difficult to be affectionately
filial.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The artificial is easier than the natural.</p></div>

<p>But even that is easier than to become unconscious
of one's natural obligations, which is in turn easier
than to cause others to be unconscious of the
operations thereof.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>I.e.</i> to be filial without letting others be conscious
of the fact.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Similarly, this is easier than to become altogether
unconscious of the world, which again is easier
than to cause the world to be unconscious of one's
influence upon it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Such is perfect charity, which operates without
letting its operation be known.</p></div>

<p>"True virtue does nothing, yet it leaves Yao and
Shun far behind. Its good influence extends to
ten thousand generations, yet no man knoweth it
to exist. What boots it then to sigh after charity
and duty to one's neighbour?</p>

<p>"Filial piety, fraternal love, charity, duty to
one's neighbour, loyalty, truth, chastity, and
honesty,&mdash;these are all studied efforts, designed to
aid the development of virtue. They are only
parts of a whole.</p>

<p>"Therefore it has been said, 'Perfect honour
includes all the honour a country can give. Perfect
wealth includes all the wealth a country can give.
Perfect ambition includes all the reputation one
can desire.' And by parity of reasoning, <span class="smcap">Tao</span> does
not admit of sub-division."</p>

<p>Pei Mên Ch'êng</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of whom nothing is recorded.</p></div>

<p>said to the Yellow Emperor, "When your Majesty
played the <em>Han-ch'ih</em></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Name of a piece of music, the meaning of which is
not known.</p></div>

<p>in the wilds of Tung-t'ing, the first time I heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
it I was afraid, the second time I was amazed, and
the last time I was confused, speechless, overwhelmed."</p>

<p>"You are not far from the truth," replied the
Yellow Emperor. "I played as a man, drawing
inspiration from God. The execution was punctilious,
the expression sublime.</p>

<p>"Perfect music first shapes itself according to a
human standard; then it follows the lines of the
divine; then it proceeds in harmony with the five
virtues; then it passes into spontaneity. The four
seasons are then blended, and all creation is
brought into accord. As the seasons come forth
in turn, so are all things produced. Now fulness,
now decay, now soft and loud in turn, now clear,
now muffled, the harmony of <em>Yin</em> and <em>Yang</em>. Like
a flash was the sound which roused you as the
insect world is roused,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By the warm breath of spring.</p></div>

<p>followed by a thundering peal, without end and
without beginning, now dying, now living, now
sinking, now rising, on and on without a moment's
break. And so you were afraid.</p>

<p>"When I played again, it was the harmony of
the <em>Yin</em> and <em>Yang</em>, lighted by the glory of sun and
moon; now broken, now prolonged, now gentle,
now severe, in one unbroken, unfathomable volume
of sound. Filling valley and gorge, stopping the
ears and dominating the senses, adapting itself to
the capacities of things,&mdash;the sound whirled around
on all sides, with shrill note and clear. The spirits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of darkness kept to their domain. Sun, moon, and
stars, pursued their appointed course. When the
melody was exhausted I stopped; if the melody
did not stop, I went on.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The music was naturally what it was, independently
of the player.</p></div>

<p>You would have sympathised, but you could not
understand. You would have looked, but you
could not see. You would have pursued, but you
could not overtake. You stood dazed in the
middle of the wilderness, leaning against a tree
and crooning, your eye conscious of exhausted
vision, your strength failing for the pursuit, and so
unable to overtake me. Your frame was but an
empty shell. You were completely at a loss, and
so you were amazed.</p>

<p>"Then I played in sounds which produce no
amazement, the melodious law of spontaneity,
springing forth like nature's countless buds, in
manifold but formless joy, as though poured forth
to the dregs, in deep but soundless bass. Beginning
nowhere, the melody rested in void; some
would say dead, others alive, others real, others
ornamental, as it scattered itself on all sides in
never to be anticipated chords.</p>

<p>"The wondering world enquires of the Sage.
He is in relation with its variations and follows the
same eternal law.</p>

<p>"When no machinery is set in motion, and yet
the instrumentation is complete, this is the music
of God. The mind awakes to its enjoyment with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>out
waiting to be called. Accordingly, Yu Piao
praised it, saying, 'Listening you cannot hear its
sound; gazing you cannot see its form.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Yu Piao is said to have been one of the pre-historic
rulers of China. Readers of the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>
(ch. xiv) will here find another nail for the coffin
of that egregious fraud. See <cite>The Remains of Lao
Tzŭ</cite>, p. 14. Also <a href="#Page_276">ch. xxii</a> of this work.</p></div>

<p>It fills heaven and earth. It embraces the six
cardinal points.' Now you desired to listen to it,
but you were not able to grasp its existence. And
so you were confused.</p>

<p>"My music first induced fear; and as a consequence,
respect. I then added amazement, by
which you were isolated.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From consciousness of your surroundings.</p></div>

<p>And lastly, confusion; for confusion means absence
of sense, and absence of sense means <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Tao</span> means absorption therein."</p>

<p>When Confucius travelled west to the Wei State,
Yen Yüan</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The "John" among the disciples of Confucius. He

<p>saying, "What think you of my Master?"</p>

<p>"Alas!" replied Shih Chin, "he is not a

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"How so?" enquired Yen Yüan.</p>

<p>"Before the straw dog has been offered in
sacrifice," replied Shih Chin, "it is kept in a box,
wrapped up in an embroidered cloth, and the augur
fasts before using it. But when it has once been
offered up, passers-by trample over its body, and
fuel-gatherers pick it up for burning. Then, if
any one should take it, and again putting it in a
box and wrapping it up in an embroidered cloth,
watch and sleep alongside, he would not only
dream, but have nightmare into the bargain.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The thing being uncanny. From which it would
appear that the use of the straw dog was to induce
dreams of future events.</p></div>

<p>"Now your Master has been thus treating the
ancients, who are like the dog which has already
been offered in sacrifice. He causes his disciples
to watch and sleep alongside of them. Consequently,
his tree</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Beneath which he used to teach.</p></div>

<p>has been cut down in Sung; they will have none
of him in Wei; in fact, his chances among the
Shangs and the Chous are exhausted. Is not this
the dream? And then to be surrounded by the
Ch'êns and the Ts'ais, seven days without food,
death staring him in the face,&mdash;is not this the
nightmare?</p>

<p>"For travelling by water there is nothing like a
boat. For travelling by land there is nothing like
a cart. This because a boat moves readily in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
water; but were you to try to push it on land you
would never succeed in making it go.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Be in harmony with your surroundings.</p></div>

<p>Now ancient and modern times may be likened
unto water and land; Chou and Lu to the boat
and the cart. To try to make the customs of Chou
succeed in Lu, is like pushing a boat on land: great
trouble and no result, except certain injury to oneself.
Your Master has not yet learnt the doctrine
of non-angularity, of self-adaptation to externals.</p>

<p>"Have you never seen a well-sweep? You pull
it, and down it comes. You release it, and up it
goes. It is the man who pulls the well-sweep, and
not the well-sweep which pulls the man; so that
both in coming down and going up, it does not
run counter to the wishes of the man. And so it
was that the ceremonial and obligations and laws
of the Three Emperors and Five Rulers did not
aim at uniformity of application but at good
government of the empire. Their ceremonial,
obligations, laws, etc., were like the cherry-apple,
the pear, the orange, and the pumelo,&mdash;all differing
in flavour but each palatable. They changed with
the changing season.</p>

result was that the rich people of the place barred
up their doors and would not come out, while the
poor people took their wives and children and
departed elsewhere. That woman saw the beauty

<p>Confucius had lived to the age of fifty-one without
hearing <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, when he went south to P'ei, to
see Lao Tzŭ.</p>

<p>Lao Tzŭ said, "So you have come, Sir, have
you? I hear you are considered a wise man up
north. Have you got <span class="smcap">Tao</span>?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," answered Confucius.</p>

<p>"In what direction," asked Lao Tzŭ, "have you
sought for it?"</p>

<p>"I sought it for five years," replied Confucius,
"in the science of numbers, but did not succeed."</p>

<p>"And then?..." continued Lao Tzŭ.</p>

<p>"Then," said Confucius, "I spent twelve years
seeking for it in the doctrine of the <em>Yin</em> and <em>Yang</em>,
also without success."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just so," rejoined Lao Tzŭ. "Were <span class="smcap">Tao</span> something
which could be presented, there is no man
but would present it to his sovereign, or to his
parents. Could it be imparted or given, there is no
man but would impart it to his brother or give
it to his child. But this is impossible, for the
following reason. Unless there is a suitable endowment
within, <span class="smcap">Tao</span> will not abide. Unless there is
outward correctness, <span class="smcap">Tao</span> will not operate. The
external being unfitted for the impression of the
internal, the true Sage does not seek to imprint.
The internal being unfitted for the reception of the
external, the true Sage does not seek to receive.</p>

<p>"Reputation is public property; you may not
appropriate it in excess. Charity and duty to one's
neighbour are as caravanserais established by wise
rulers of old; you may stop there one night, but
not for long, or you will incur reproach.</p>

<p>"The perfect men of old took their road through
charity, stopping a night with duty to their neighbour,
on their way to ramble in transcendental
space. Feeding on the produce of non-cultivation,
and establishing themselves in the domain of no
obligations, they enjoyed their transcendental inaction.
Their food was ready to hand; and being
under no obligations to others, they did not put
any one under obligation to themselves. The
ancients called this the outward visible sign of an
inward and spiritual grace.</p>

<p>"Those who make wealth their all in all, cannot
bear loss of money. Those who make distinction
their all in all, cannot bear loss of fame. Those who
affect power will not place authority in the hands of
others. Anxious while holding, distressed if losing,
yet never taking warning from the past and seeing
the folly of their pursuit,&mdash;such men are the accursed
of God.</p>

<p>"Resentment, gratitude, taking, giving, censure
of self, instruction of others, power of life and
death,&mdash;these eight are the instruments of right;
but only he who can adapt himself to the vicissitudes
of fortune, without being carried away, is fit
to use them. Such a one is an upright man among
the upright. And he whose heart is not so constituted,&mdash;the
door of divine intelligence is not yet
opened for him."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Confucius visited Lao Tzŭ, and spoke of charity
and duty to one's neighbour.</p>

<p>Lao Tzŭ said, "The chaff from winnowing will
blind a man's eyes so that he cannot tell the points
of the compass. Mosquitoes will keep a man awake
all night with their biting. And just in the same
way this talk of charity and duty to one's neighbour
drives me nearly crazy. Sir! strive to keep the
world to its own original simplicity. And as the
wind bloweth where it listeth, so let Virtue establish
itself. Wherefore such undue energy, as though
searching for a fugitive with a big drum?</p>

<p>"The snow-goose is white without a daily bath.
The raven is black without daily colouring itself.
The original simplicity of black and of white is beyond
the reach of argument. The vista of fame and
reputation is not worthy of enlargement. When the
pond dries up and the fishes are left upon dry
ground, to moisten them with the breath or to
damp them with a little spittle is not to be compared
with leaving them in the first instance in their
native rivers and lakes."</p>

Confucius did not speak for three days. A
disciple asked him, saying, "Master, when you
saw Lao Tzŭ, in what direction did you admonish
him?"</p>

<p>"I saw a Dragon," replied Confucius, "&mdash;a
Dragon which by convergence showed a body, by
radiation became colour, and riding upon the
clouds of heaven, nourished the two Principles of
Creation. My mouth was agape: I could not
shut it. How then do you think I was going to
admonish Lao Tzŭ?"</p>

<p>Upon this Tzŭ Kung remarked, "Ha! then a
man can sit corpse-like manifesting his dragon-power
around, his thunder-voice heard though
profound silence reigns, his movements like
those of the universe? I too would go and see
him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>So on the strength of his connection with Confucius,
Tzŭ Kung obtained an interview. Lao Tzŭ
received him distantly and with dignity, saying in a
low voice, "I am old, Sir. What injunctions may
you have to give me?"</p>

<p>"The administration of the Three Kings and of
the Five Rulers," replied Tzŭ Kung, "was not
uniform; but their reputation has been identical.
How then, Sir, is it that you do not regard them
as Sages?"</p>

<p>"Come nearer, my son," said Lao Tzŭ. "What
mean you by <em>not uniform</em>?"</p>

<p>"Yao handed over the empire to Shun," replied
Tzŭ Kung; "and Shun to Yü. Yü employed
labour, and T'ang employed troops. Wên Wang
followed Chou Hsin and did not venture to oppose
him. Wu Wang opposed him and would not
follow. Therefore I said <em>not uniform</em>."</p>

<p>"Come nearer, my son," said Lao Tzŭ, "and I will
tell you about the Three Kings and the Five Rulers.</p>

<p>"The Yellow Emperor's administration caused
the affections of the people to be catholic. Nobody
wept for the death of his parents, and nobody found
fault.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All loved each other equally.</p></div>

<p>"The administration of Yao diverted the affections
of the people into particular channels. If
a man slew the slayer of his parents, nobody
blamed him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Filial affection began to predominate.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"The administration of Shun brought a spirit
of rivalry among the people. Children were born
after ten months' gestation; when five months
old, they could speak; and ere they were three
years of age,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Including gestation.</p></div>

<p>could already tell one person from another. And
so early death came into the world.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A veritable anti-climax, hopelessly unworthy of either
Lao Tzŭ or Chuang Tzŭ.</p></div>

<p>"The administration of Yü wrought a change
in the hearts of the people. Individuality prevailed,
and force was called into play. Killing robbers
was not accounted murder; and throughout
the empire people became sub-divided into classes.
There was great alarm on all sides, and the Confucianists
and the Mihists arose. At first the
relationships were duly observed; but what about
the women of to-day?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Meaning that in the olden days men could not marry
before thirty, women before twenty, whereas now the
State is cursed with early marriages. Or, according
to Dr. Legge's view of a famous passage in the
Book of Rites, that formerly it was shameful in men
and women not to be married at the age of thirty
and twenty, respectively, whereas now the State is
cursed with late marriages.</p></div>

<p>"Let me tell you. The government of the
Three Kings and Five Rulers was so only in name.
In reality, it was utter confusion. The wisdom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the Three Kings was opposed to the brilliancy of
the sun and moon above, destructive of the energy
of land and water below, and subversive of the
influence of the four seasons between.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>More repetition. See <a href="#Page_110">ch. x</a>. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad fin.</i></p></div>

<p>That wisdom is more harmful than a hornet's tail,
preventing the very animals from putting themselves
into due relation with the conditions of
their existence&mdash;and yet they call themselves Sages!
Is not their shamelessness shameful indeed?"</p>

<p>At this Tzŭ Kung became ill at ease.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The whole of the above episode may without
hesitation be written off as a feeble forgery.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Confucius said to Lao Tzŭ, "I arranged the Six
Canons of Poetry, History, Rites, Music, Changes,
and Spring and Autumn. I spent much time over
them, and I am well acquainted with their purport.
I used them in admonishing seventy-two rulers,
by discourses on the wisdom of ancient sovereigns
and illustrations from the lives of Chou and Shao.
Yet not one ruler has in any way adopted my suggestions.
Alas that man should be so difficult to
persuade, and wisdom so difficult to illustrate."</p>

<p>"It is well for you, Sir," replied Lao Tzŭ, "that
you did not come across any real ruler of mankind.
Your Six Canons are but the worn-out foot-prints
of ancient Sages. And what are foot-prints? Why,
the words you now utter are as it were foot-prints.
Foot-prints are made by the shoe: they are not the
shoe itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fish-hawks gaze at each other with motionless
eyes,&mdash;and their young are produced. The male
of a certain insect chirps with the wind while the
female chirps against it,&mdash;and their offspring is
produced. There is another animal which, being
an hermaphrodite, produces its own offspring.
Nature cannot be changed. Destiny cannot be
altered. Time cannot stop. <span class="smcap">Tao</span> cannot be obstructed.
Once attain to <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, and there is nothing
which you cannot accomplish. Without it, there
is nothing which you can accomplish."</p>

<p>For three months after this Confucius did not
leave his house. Then he again visited Lao Tzŭ
and said, "I have attained. Birds lay eggs, fish
spawn, insects undergo metamorphosis, and mammals
suckle their young.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Lit.</i> "when a younger brother comes, the elder
cries,"&mdash;from which may be inferred the meaning
in the translation.</p>

<p>The whole sentence signifies that every development
proceeds according to fixed laws. It is useless to try
to <em>do</em> anything. Nature is always self-similar.</p></div>

<p>For a long time I have not been enlightened. And
he who is not enlightened himself,&mdash;how should
he enlighten others?"</p>

<p>Lao Tzŭ said, "Ch'iu, you have attained!"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The style of this chapter," says Lin Hsi Chung,
"gives it a foremost place among the 'outside'
essays of Chuang Tzŭ. But the insertion of that
dialogue between Confucius and Lao Tzŭ on charity
and duty towards one's neighbour is like eking out a
sable robe with a dog's tail."</p></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Self-conceit</span> and assurance, which lead
men to quit society, and be different from
their fellows, to indulge in tall talk and abuse
of others,&mdash;these are nothing more than personal
over-estimation, the affectation of recluses and
those who have done with the world and have
closed their hearts to mundane influences.</p>

<p>Preaching of charity and duty to one's neighbour,
of loyalty and truth, of respect, of economy,
and of humility,&mdash;this is but moral culture, affected
by would-be pacificators and teachers of mankind,
and by scholars at home or abroad.</p>

<p>Preaching of meritorious services, of fame, of
ceremonial between sovereign and minister, of due
relationship between upper and lower classes,&mdash;this
is mere government, affected by courtiers or
patriots who strive to extend the boundaries of
their own State and to swallow up the territory of
others.</p>

<p>Living in marshes or in wildernesses, and passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>

by wanderers who have turned their backs upon the
world and have nothing better to do.</p>

<p>Exhaling and inhaling,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As these creatures are supposed to do in order to

<p>&mdash;this is but valetudinarianism, affected by professors
of hygiene and those who try to preserve
the body to the age of P'êng Tsu.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See <a href="#Page_1">ch. i</a>.</p></div>

<p>But in self-esteem without self-conceit, in moral
culture without charity and duty to one's neighbour,
in government without rank and fame, in
retirement without solitude, in health without
hygiene,&mdash;there we have oblivion absolute coupled
with possession of all things; an infinite calm
which becomes an object to be attained by all.</p>

<p>Such is the <span class="smcap">Tao</span> of the universe, such is the
virtue of the Sage. Wherefore it has been said,
"In tranquillity, in stillness, in the unconditioned,
in inaction, we find the levels of the universe, the
very constitution of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Almost verbatim from <a href="#Page_157">ch. xiii</a>, p. <a href="#Page_158">158</a>, where the
passage appears as part of Chuang Tzŭ's own text,
and not as a quotation from any other author.</p></div>

<p>Wherefore it has been said, "The Sage is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
negative quantity, and is consequently in a state
of passivity. Being passive he is in a state of
repose. And where passivity and repose are, there
sorrow and anxiety do not enter, and foul influences
do not collect. And thus his virtue is
complete and his spirituality unimpaired."</p>

<p>Wherefore it has been said, "The birth of the
Sage is the will of God; his death is but a modification
of existence. In repose, he shares the
passivity of the <em>Yin</em>; in action, the energy of the
<em>Yang</em>. He will have nothing to do with happiness,
and so has nothing to do with misfortune.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Each of which proceeds from the other in an endless
chain.</p></div>

<p>He must be influenced ere he will respond. He
must be urged ere he will move. He must be
compelled ere he will arise. Ignoring the future
and the past, he resigns himself to the laws of
God.</p>

<p>"And therefore no calamity comes upon him,
nothing injures him, no man is against him, no
spirit punishes him. He floats through life to
rest in death. He has no anxieties; he makes no
plans. His honour does not make him illustrious.
His good faith reflects no credit upon himself.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is all God's, as part of the great scheme.</p></div>

<p>His sleep is dreamless, his awaking without pain.
His spirituality is pure,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Without desires.</p></div>

<p>and his soul vigorous. Thus unconditioned and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
in repose, he is a partaker of the virtue of
God."</p>

<p>Wherefore it has been said, "Sorrow and happiness
are the heresies</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Evil influences.</p></div>

<p>of virtue; joy and anger lead astray from <span class="smcap">Tao</span>;
love and hate cause the loss of virtue. The heart
unconscious of sorrow and happiness,&mdash;that is
perfect virtue. <span class="smcap">One</span>, without change,&mdash;that is
perfect repose. Without any obstruction,&mdash;that is
the perfection of the unconditioned. Holding no
relations with the external world,&mdash;that is perfection
of the negative state. Without blemish of any
kind,&mdash;that is the perfection of purity."</p>

<p>Wherefore it has been said, "If the body toils
without rest, it dies. If the mind is employed
without ceasing, it becomes wearied; and being
wearied, its power is gone."</p>

<p>Pure water is by nature clear. If untouched, it
is smooth. If dammed, it will not flow, neither
will it be clear. It is an emblem of the virtue of
God. Wherefore it has been said, "Pure, without
admixture; uniform, without change; negative,
without action; moved, only at the will of God;&mdash;such
would be the spirituality nourished according
to <span class="smcap">Tao</span>."</p>

precious in the extreme. The spirit spreads forth
on all sides: there is no point to which it does
not reach, attaining heaven above, embracing earth
beneath. Influencing all creation, its form cannot
be portrayed. Its name is then <em>Of-God</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Such is man's spiritual existence before he is born
into the world of mortals.</p></div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Tao</span> of the pure and simple consists in
preserving spirituality. He who preserves his
spirituality and loses it not, becomes one with that
spirituality. And through that unity the spirit
operates freely, and comes into due relationship
with God.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Returning after its brief career on earth, to the
eternity whence it came.</p></div>

<p>A vulgar saying has it, "The masses value
money; honest men, fame; virtuous men, resolution;
and Sages, the soul."</p>

<p>Thus, the pure is that in which there is nothing
mixed; the simple is that which implies no injury
to the spirituality. And he who can keep the pure
and simple within himself,&mdash;he is a divine man.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Exercise of Faculties.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Argument</i>:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tao</span> unattainable by mundane arts&mdash;To be reached through
repose&mdash;The world's infancy&mdash;The reign of peace&mdash;Government sets
in&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tao</span> declines&mdash;The true Sages of old&mdash;Their purity of aim.</p></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Those</span> who exercise their faculties in mere
worldly studies, hoping thereby to revert to
their original condition; and those who sink their
aspirations in mundane thoughts, hoping thereby
to reach enlightenment;&mdash;these are the dullards of
the earth.</p>

<p>The ancients, in cultivating <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, begat knowledge
out of repose. When born, this knowledge
was not applied to any purpose; and so it may be
said that out of knowledge they begat repose.
Knowledge and repose thus mutually producing
each other, harmony and order were developed.
Virtue is harmony; <span class="smcap">Tao</span> is order.</p>

<p>Virtue all-embracing,&mdash;hence charity. <span class="smcap">Tao</span> all-influencing,&mdash;hence
duty to one's neighbour. From
the establishment of these two springs loyalty.
Then comes music, an expression of inward purity
and truth; followed by ceremonial, or sincerity expressed
in ornamental guise. If music and
ceremonial are ill regulated, the empire is plunged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
into confusion. And to attempt to correct others
while one's own virtue is clouded, is to set one's
own virtue a task for which it is inadequate, the
result being that the natural constitution of the
object will suffer.</p>

<p>Primeval man enjoyed perfect tranquillity
throughout life. In his day, the Positive and
Negative principles were peacefully united; spiritual
beings gave no trouble; the four seasons
followed in due order; nothing suffered any injury;
death was unknown; men had knowledge, but no
occasion to use it. This may be called perfection
of unity.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All things, all conditions, were <span class="smcap">One</span>.</p></div>

<p>At that period, nothing was ever made so; but everything
was so.</p>

<p>By and by, virtue declined. Sui Jen</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Prometheus of China.</p></div>

<p>and Fu Hsi</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See <a href="#Page_68">ch. vi</a>.</p></div>

<p>ruled the empire. There was still natural adaptation,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of man to his surroundings.</p></div>

<p>but the unity was gone.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The tide of coercion had set in.</p></div>

<p>A further decline in virtue. Shên Nung</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The inventor of agriculture.</p></div>

<p>and Huang Ti</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Yellow Emperor. See <a href="#Page_68">ch. vi</a>.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>ruled the empire. There was peace, but the natural
adaptation was gone.</p>

<p>Again virtue declined. Yao and Shun ruled the
empire. Systems of government and moral reform
were introduced. Man's original integrity was
scattered. Goodness led him astray from <span class="smcap">Tao</span>;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But for goodness, evil could not exist.</p></div>

<p>his actions imperilled his virtue.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As opposed to inaction.</p></div>

<p>Then he discarded natural instinct and took up
with the intellectual. Mind was pitted against mind,
but it was impossible thus to settle the empire. So
art and learning were added. But art obliterated
the original constitution, and learning overwhelmed
mind; upon which confusion set in, and man was
unable to revert to his natural instincts, to the
condition in which he at first existed.</p>

<p>Thus it may be said that the world destroys <span class="smcap">Tao</span>,
and that <span class="smcap">Tao</span> destroys the world. And the world
and <span class="smcap">Tao</span> thus mutually destroying each other, how
can the men of <span class="smcap">Tao</span> elevate the world, and how can
the world elevate <span class="smcap">Tao</span>? <span class="smcap">Tao</span> cannot elevate the
world; neither can the world elevate <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. Though
the Sages were not to dwell on mountain and in
forest, their virtue would still be hidden;&mdash;hidden,
but not by themselves.</p>

<p>Those of old who were called retired scholars,
were not men who hid their bodies, or kept back
their words, or concealed their wisdom. It was
that the age was not suitable for their mission. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the age was suitable and their mission a success
over the empire, they simply effaced themselves in
the unity which prevailed. If the age was unsuitable
and their mission at failure, they fell back upon
their own resources and waited. Such is the way to
preserve oneself.</p>

<p>Those of old who preserved themselves, did not
ornament their knowledge with rhetoric. They did
not exhaust the empire with their knowledge.
They did not exhaust virtue. They kept quietly
to their own spheres, and reverted to their natural
instincts. What then was left for them to <em>do</em>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tao</span> does not deal with detail. Virtue does not
take cognizance of trifles. Trifles injure virtue;
detail injures <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. Wherefore it has been said,
"Self-reformation is enough." He whose happiness
is complete has attained his desire.</p>

<p>Of old, attainment of desire did not mean <em>office</em>.
It meant that nothing could be added to the sum of
happiness. But now it does mean office, though
office is external and is not a part of oneself. That
which is adventitious, comes. Coming, you cannot
prevent it; going, you cannot arrest it. Therefore,
not to look on office as the attainment of desire, and
not because of poverty to become a toady, but to be
equally happy under all conditions,&mdash;this is to be
without sorrow.</p>

<p>But now-a-days, both having and not having</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Office.</p></div>

<p>are causes of unhappiness. From which we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
infer that even happiness is not exempt from
sorrow.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</i>.</p></div>

<p>Wherefore it has been said, "Those who over-estimate
the external and lose their natural instincts
in worldliness,&mdash;these are the people of topsy-turvydom."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We are left in the dark as to the authorship of the

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was the time of autumn floods. Every stream
poured into the river, which swelled in its
turbid course. The banks receded so far from one
another that it was impossible to tell a cow from a
horse.</p>

<p>Then the Spirit of the River laughed for joy that
all the beauty of the earth was gathered to himself.
Down with the stream he journeyed east, until he
reached the ocean. There, looking eastwards and
seeing no limit to its waves, his countenance
changed. And as he gazed over the expanse, he
sighed and said to the Spirit of the Ocean, "A
vulgar proverb says that he who has heard but part
of the truth thinks no one equal to himself. And
such a one am I.</p>

<p>"When formerly I heard people detracting from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>

of Poh I,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

laughing-stock to those of comprehensive enlightenment!"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Spirit of a paltry river learns that the ripple of
his rustic stream is scarcely the murmur of the
world.</p></div>

<p>To which the Spirit of the Ocean replied, "You
cannot speak of ocean to a well-frog,&mdash;the creature
of a narrower sphere. You cannot speak of ice to
a summer insect,&mdash;the creature of a season. You
cannot speak of <span class="smcap">Tao</span> to a pedagogue: his scope is
too restricted. But now that you have emerged
from your narrow sphere and have seen the great
ocean, you know your own insignificance, and I can
speak to you of great principles.</p>

<p>"There is no body of water beneath the canopy
of heaven which is greater than ocean. All streams
pour into it without cease, yet it does not overflow.
It is constantly being drained off, yet it is never
empty. Spring and autumn bring no change;
floods and droughts are equally unknown. And
thus it is immeasurably superior to mere rivers and

this account, for I get my shape from the universe,
my vital power from the <em>Yin</em> and <em>Yang</em>. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
universe I am but as a small stone or a small tree
on a vast mountain. And conscious thus of my
own insignificance, what is there of which I can
boast?</p>

<p>"The Four Seas,&mdash;are they not to the universe
but like puddles in a marsh? The Middle Kingdom,&mdash;is
it not to the surrounding ocean like a tare-seed
in a granary? Of all the myriad created things,
man is but one. And of all those who inhabit the
land, live on the fruit of the earth, and move about
in cart and boat, an individual man is but one. Is
not he, as compared with all creation, but as the
tip of a hair upon a horse's skin?</p>

<p>"The succession of the Five Rulers, the contentions
of the Three Kings, the griefs of the philanthropist,
the labours of the administrator, are but
this and nothing more.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Sc.</i> ambition.</p></div>

<p>Poh I refused the throne for fame's sake. Confucius
discoursed to get a reputation for learning. This
over-estimation of self on their part, was it not very
much your own in reference to water?"</p>

<p>"Very well," replied the Spirit of the River, "am
I then to regard the universe as great and the tip of
a hair as small?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said the Spirit of the Ocean.
"Dimensions are limitless; time is endless. Conditions
are not invariable; terms are not final.
Thus, the wise man looks into space, and does not
regard the small as too little, nor the great as too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
much; for he knows that there is no limit to
dimension. He looks back into the past, and does
not grieve over what is far off, nor rejoice over what
is near; for he knows that time is without end.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Space infinite has been illustrated by Locke by a
centre from which you can proceed for ever in all
directions. Time infinite, by a point in a line from
which you can proceed backwards and forwards for

<p>He investigates fulness and decay, and does not
rejoice if he succeeds, nor lament if he fails; for he
knows that conditions are not invariable.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Fulness and decay are the inevitable precursors of
each other.</p></div>

<p>He who clearly apprehends the scheme of existence,
does not rejoice over life, nor repine at death; for he
knows that terms are not final.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Life and death are but links in an endless chain.</p></div>

<p>"What man knows is not to be compared with
what he does not know. The span of his existence
is not to be compared with the span of his non-existence.
With the small to strive to exhaust the
great, necessarily lands him in confusion, and he
does not attain his object. How then should one
be able to say that the tip of a hair is the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ne plus
ultra</i> of smallness, or that the universe is the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ne
plus ultra</i> of greatness?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These predicates are abstract terms, which are not
names of real existences but of relations, states, or
conditions of existences; not things, but conditions
of things.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dialecticians of the day," replied the Spirit of
the River, "all say that the infinitesimally small
has no form, and that the infinitesimally great
is beyond all measurement. Is that so?"</p>

<p>"If we regard greatness as compared with that
which is small," said the Spirit of the Ocean,
"there is no limit to it; and if we regard smallness
as compared with that which is great, it eludes
our sight.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That is, if we proceed from the concrete to the
abstract. Given a large or a small thing, there is
no limit to the smallness or greatness with which
each may be respectively compared.</p></div>

<p>The infinitesimal is a subdivision of the small; the
colossal is an extension of the great. In this sense
the two fall into different categories.</p>

<p>"Both small and great things must equally
possess form. The mind cannot picture to itself a
thing without form, nor conceive a form of unlimited
dimensions. The greatness of anything
may be a topic of discussion, or the smallness of
anything may be mentally realized. But that
which can be neither a topic of discussion nor be
realized mentally, can be neither great nor small.</p>

<p>"Therefore, the truly great man, although he
does not injure others, does not credit himself with
charity and mercy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These are natural to him.</p></div>

<p>He seeks not gain, but does not despise his followers
who do. He struggles not for wealth, but does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
not take credit for letting it alone. He asks help
from no man, but takes no credit for his self-reliance,
neither does he despise those who seek
preferment through friends. He acts differently
from the vulgar crowd, but takes no credit for his
exceptionality; nor because others act with the
majority does he despise them as hypocrites. The
ranks and emoluments of the world are to him no
cause for joy; its punishments and shame no cause
for disgrace. He knows that positive and negative
cannot be distinguished,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What is positive under certain conditions will be
negative under others. These terms are in fact
identical. See <a href="#Page_12">ch. ii</a>.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They are infinite.</p></div>

<p>"I have heard say, the man of <span class="smcap">Tao</span> has no reputation;
perfect virtue acquires nothing; the truly
great man ignores self;&mdash;this is the height of self-discipline."</p>

<p>Clause 2 of the above quotation appears with variations
in ch. xxxviii of the <cite>Tao-Te-Ching</cite>. The

<p>"But how then," asked the Spirit of the River,
"are the internal and external extremes of value
and worthlessness, of greatness and smallness, to be
determined?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>With no standard of measurement.</p></div>

<p>"From the point of view of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>," replied the
Spirit of the Ocean, "there are no such extremes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of value or worthlessness. Men individually value
themselves and hold others cheap. The world
collectively withholds from the individual the right
of appraising himself.</p>

<p>"If we say that a thing is great or small because
it is relatively great or small, then there is nothing
in all creation which is not great, nothing which is
not small. To know that the universe is but as a
tare-seed, and that the tip of a hair is a mountain,&mdash;this
is the expression of relativity.</p>

<p>"If we say that something exists or does not
exist, in deference to the function it fulfils or does
not fulfil, then there is nothing which does not
exist, nothing which does exist. To know that east
and west are convertible and yet necessary terms,&mdash;this
is the due adjustment of functions.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Any given point is of course east in relation to west,
west in relation to east. Absolutely, it may be said
that its westness does not exclude its eastness; or,
that it is neither east nor west.</p></div>

<p>"If we say that anything is good or evil because
it is either good or evil in our eyes, then there is
nothing which is not good, nothing which is not
evil. To know that Yao and Chieh were both good
and both evil from their opposite points of view,&mdash;this
is the expression of a standard.</p>

<p>"Of old Yao abdicated in favour of Shun, and the
latter ruled. Kuei abdicated in favour of Chih,

or fighting, of acting like Yao or like Chieh,
must be determined according to the opportunity,
and may not be regarded as a constant quantity.</p>

Different creatures are differently constituted.</p>

<p>"Thus, as has been said, those who would have
right without its correlative, wrong; or good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
government without its correlative, misrule,&mdash;they
do not apprehend the great principles of the universe
nor the conditions to which all creation is
subject. One might as well talk of the existence of
heaven without that of earth, or of the negative
principle without the positive, which is clearly
absurd. Such people, if they do not yield to argument,
must be either fools or knaves.</p>

<p>"Rulers have abdicated under different conditions,
dynasties have been continued under different
conditions. Those who did not hit off a favourable
time and were in opposition to their age,&mdash;they were
called usurpers. Those who did hit off the right
time and were in harmony with their age,&mdash;they
were called patriots. Fair and softly, my River
friend; what should you know of value and worthlessness,
of great and small?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is therefore quite unnecessary to teach you where
to fix the limits of that of which you know nothing.</p></div>

<p>"In this case," replied the Spirit of the River,
"what am I to do and what am I not to do? How
am I to arrange my declinings and receivings, my
takings-hold and my lettings-go?"</p>

<p>"From the point of view of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>," said the Spirit
of the Ocean, "value and worthlessness are like
slopes and plains.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A slope to-day may be a plain to-morrow.</p></div>

<p>To consider either as absolutely such would involve
great injury to <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. Few and many are like giving
and receiving presents. These must not be regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
from one side, or there will be great confusion to
<span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It would be unfair only to regard, from the receiver's
standpoint, the amount given. The intention of the
giver must also be taken into the calculation.</p></div>

<p>Be discriminating, as the ruler of a State whose
administration is impartial. Be dispassionate, as
the worshipped deity whose dispensation is impartial.
Be expansive, like the points of the compass,
to whose boundlessness no limit is set. Embrace
all creation, and none shall be more sheltered than
another. This is the unconditioned. And where
all things are equal, how can we have the long and
the short?</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Tao</span> is without beginning, without end. Other
things are born and die. They are impermanent;
and now for better, now for worse, they are ceaselessly
changing form. Past years cannot be recalled:
time cannot be arrested. The succession of states
is endless; and every end is followed by a new
beginning. Thus it may be said that man's duty to
his neighbour is embodied in the eternal principles
of the universe.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All he has to <em>do</em> is to <em>be</em>.</p></div>

<p>"The life of man passes by like a galloping
horse, changing at every turn, at every hour. What
should he do, or what should he not do, other than
let his decomposition go on?"</p>

<p>"If this is the case," retorted the Spirit of the
River, "pray what is the value of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"Those who understand <span class="smcap">Tao</span>," answered the
Spirit of the Ocean, "must necessarily apprehend
the eternal principles above mentioned and be
clear as to their application. Consequently, they
do not suffer any injury from without.</p>

<p>"The man of perfect virtue cannot be burnt by
fire, nor drowned in water, nor hurt by frost or sun,
nor torn by wild bird or beast. Not that he makes
light of these; but that he discriminates between
safety and danger. Happy under prosperous and
adverse circumstances alike, cautious as to what
he discards and what he accepts;&mdash;nothing can
harm him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Plato taught that it was impossible to make a slave
of a wise man, meaning that the latter by virtue of
his mental endowment would rise superior to mere
physical thrall. "A wise and just man," said he,
"could be as happy in a state of slavery as in a state
of freedom."</p></div>

<p>"Therefore it has been said that the natural
abides within, the artificial without. Virtue abides
in the natural. Knowledge of the action of the
natural and of the artificial has its root in the
natural, its development in virtue. And thus,
whether in motion or at rest, whether in expansion
or in contraction, there is always a reversion to the
essential and to the ultimate."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Those eternal principles which embody all human
obligations.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you mean," enquired the Spirit of the
River, "by the natural and the artificial?"</p>

<p>"Horses and oxen," answered the Spirit of the
Ocean, "have four feet. That is the natural. Put
a halter on a horse's head, a string through a
bullock's nose,&mdash;that is the artificial.</p>

<p>"Therefore it has been said, do not let the artificial
obliterate the natural; do not let will obliterate
destiny; do not let virtue be sacrificed to fame.
Diligently observe these precepts without fail, and
thus you will revert to the divine."</p>

For a long time I have been seeking success, but in

knew all about the practice of charity and duty to
one's neighbour, the identification of like and unlike,
the separation of hardness and whiteness, and about
making the not-so so, and the impossible possible.
I vanquished the wisdom of all the philosophies. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
exhausted all the arguments that were brought
against me. I thought that I had indeed reached
the goal. But now that I have heard Chuang Tzŭ,
I am lost in astonishment at his grandeur. I know
not whether it is in arguing or in knowledge that I
am not equal to him. I can no longer open my
mouth. May I ask you to impart to me the
secret?"</p>

<p>Kung Tzŭ Mou leant over the table and sighed.
Then he looked up to heaven, and smiling replied,
saying, "Have you never heard of the frog in the
old well?&mdash;The frog said to the turtle of the eastern
sea, 'Happy indeed am I! I hop on to the rail
around the well. I rest in the hollow of some broken
brick. Swimming, I gather the water under my
arms and shut my mouth. I plunge into the mud,
burying my feet and toes; and not one of the
cockles, crabs, or tadpoles I see around me are my
match. [Fancy pitting the happiness of an old well
against all the water of Ocean!] Why do you not
come, Sir, and pay me a visit?'</p>

<p>"Now the turtle of the eastern sea had not got
its left leg down ere its right had already stuck fast,
so it shrank back and begged to be excused. It then
described the sea, saying, 'A thousand <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i> would
not measure its breadth, nor a thousand fathoms its
depth. In the days of the Great Yü, there were nine
years of flood out of ten; but this did not add to
its bulk. In the days of T'ang, there were seven
years out of eight of drought; but this did not
narrow its span. Not to be affected by duration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
time, not to be affected by volume of water,&mdash;such
is the great happiness of the eastern sea.'</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To be impervious to external influences.</p></div>

whose knowledge does not reach to the positive-negative
domain,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>to attempt to understand Chuang Tzŭ, is like a

victories as you have enumerated,&mdash;is not he like
the frog in the well?</p>

soaring to heaven above. For him north and south
do not exist; the four points are gone; he is engulphed

gone back to <span class="smcap">Tao</span>; and yet you think you are going

Chuang Tzŭ went thither to visit him.</p>

<p>Some one remarked, "Chuang Tzŭ has come.
He wants to be minister in your place."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Thereupon Hui Tzŭ was afraid, and searched
all over the State</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>With warrants.</p></div>

<p>for three days and three nights to find him.</p>

<p>Then Chuang Tzŭ went to see Hui Tzŭ, and
said, "In the south there is a bird. It is a kind of
phœnix. Do you know it? It started from the
south sea to fly to the north sea. Except on the
<em>wu-t'ung</em> tree,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><cite>Eleococca verrucosa</cite>. Williams.</p></div>

<p>it would not alight. It would eat nothing but the
fruit of the bamboo, drink nothing but the purest
spring water. An owl which had got the rotten
carcass of a rat, looked up as the phœnix flew by,
and screeched.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To warn it off.</p></div>

<p>Are you not screeching at me over your kingdom of
Liang?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Chuang Tzŭ and Hui Tzŭ had strolled on to the
bridge over the Hao, when the former observed,
"See how the minnows are darting about! That is
the pleasure of fishes."</p>

<p>"You not being a fish yourself," said Hui Tzŭ,
"how can you possibly know in what consists the
pleasure of fishes?"</p>

<p>"And you not being I," retorted Chuang Tzŭ,
"how can you know that I do not know?"</p>

<p>"If I, not being you, cannot know what you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
know," urged Hui Tzŭ, "it follows that you, not
being a fish, cannot know in what consists the
pleasure of fishes."</p>

<p>"Let us go back," said Chuang Tzŭ, "to your
original question. You asked me how I knew in
what consists the pleasure of fishes. Your very
question shows that you knew I knew.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For you asked me <em>how</em> I <em>knew</em>.</p></div>

<p>I knew it from my own feelings on this bridge."</p>

<p>From my own feelings above the bridge I infer those

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Perfect Happiness.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Argument</i>:&mdash;The uncertainty of human happiness&mdash;What the world aims
at is physical well-being&mdash;This is not profitable even to the body&mdash;In
inaction alone is true happiness to be found&mdash;Inaction the rule of
the material universe&mdash;Acquiescence in whatever our destiny may
bring forth&mdash;Illustrations.</p></div>

<p>[This chapter is supplementary to chapter vi.]</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Is</span> perfect happiness to be found on earth, or not?
Are there those who can enjoy life, or not? If
so, what do they do, what do they affect, what do
they avoid, what do they rest in, accept, reject, like,
and dislike?</p>

<p>What the world esteems comprises wealth, rank,
old age, and goodness of heart. What it enjoys
comprises comfort, rich food, fine clothes, beauty, and
music. What it does not esteem comprises poverty,
want of position, early death, and evil behaviour.
What it does not enjoy comprises lack of comfort
for the body, lack of rich food for the palate, lack of
fine clothes for the back, lack of beauty for the eye,
and lack of music for the ear. If men do not get
these, they are greatly miserable. Yet from the
point of view of our physical frame, this is folly.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Physically we can, and most of us do, get along
very well without these extras.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Wealthy people who toil and moil, putting together
more money than they can possibly use,&mdash;from
the point of view of our physical frame, is not
this going beyond the mark?</p>

<p>Officials of rank who turn night into day in their
endeavours to compass the best ends;&mdash;from the
point of view of our physical frame, is not this a
divergence?</p>

<p>Man is born to sorrow, and what misery is theirs
whose old age with dulled faculties only means
prolonged sorrow! From the point of view of our
physical frame, this is going far astray.</p>

<p>Patriots are in the world's opinion admittedly
good. Yet their goodness does not enable them to
enjoy life;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Patriotism has been illustrated in China by countless
heroic deeds, associated always with the death of the
hero concerned.</p></div>

<p>and so I know not whether theirs is veritable goodness
or not. If the former, it does not enable them
to enjoy life; if the latter, it at any rate enables
them to cause others to enjoy theirs.</p>

<p>It has been said, "If your loyal counsels are
not attended to, depart quietly without resistance."
Thus, when Tzŭ Hsü</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The famous Wu Yüan, 6th century B.C., whose
opposition to his sovereign led to his own disgrace
and death.</p></div>

<p>resisted, his physical frame perished; yet had he
not resisted, he would not have made his name. Is
there then really such a thing as this goodness, or not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>As to what the world does and the way in which
people are happy now, I know not whether such
happiness be real happiness or not. The happiness
of ordinary persons seems to me to consist in slavishly
following the majority, as if they could not
help it. Yet they all say they are happy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The general average of mankind are not only
moderate in intellect, but also in inclinations: they
have no tastes or wishes strong enough to incline
them to do anything unusual." Mill's <cite>Essay on
Liberty</cite>.</p></div>

<p>But I cannot say that this is happiness or that it is
not happiness. Is there then, after all, such a thing
as happiness?</p>

<p>I make true pleasure to consist in <em>inaction</em>,
which the world regards as great pain. Thus it
has been said, "Perfect happiness is the absence of
happiness;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The non-existence of any state or condition necessarily
includes the non-existence of its correlate.
If we do not have happiness, we are at once exempt
from misery; and such a negative state is a state of
"perfect happiness."</p></div>

<p>perfect renown is the absence of renown."</p>

<p>Now in this sublunary world of ours it is impossible
to assign positive and negative absolutely.
Nevertheless, in inaction they can be so assigned.
Perfect happiness and preservation of life are to be
sought for only in inaction.</p>

<p>Let us consider. Heaven does nothing; yet it
is clear. Earth does nothing; yet it enjoys repose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
From the inaction of these two proceed all the
modifications of things. How vast, how infinite is
inaction, yet without source! How infinite, how
vast, yet without form!</p>

<p>The endless varieties of things around us all
spring from inaction. Therefore it has been said,
"Heaven and earth do nothing, yet there is nothing
which they do not accomplish." But among men,
who can attain to inaction?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lin Hsi Chung condemns the whole of the above
exordium as too closely reasoned for Chuang Tzŭ,
with his rugged, elliptical style.</p></div>

<p>When Chuang Tzŭ's wife died, Hui Tzŭ went to
condole. He found the widower sitting on the
ground, singing, with his legs spread out at a right
angle, and beating time on a bowl.</p>

<p>"To live with your wife," exclaimed Hui Tzŭ,
"and see your eldest son grow up to be a man, and
then not to shed a tear over her corpse,&mdash;this would
be bad enough. But to drum on a bowl, and sing;
surely this is going too far."</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Chuang Tzŭ. "When she
died, I could not help being affected by her death.
Soon, however, I remembered that she had already
existed in a previous state before birth, without
form, or even substance; that while in that unconditioned
condition, substance was added to spirit;
that this substance then assumed form; and that
the next stage was birth. And now, by virtue of a
further change, she is dead, passing from one phase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
to another like the sequence of spring, summer,
autumn, and winter. And while she is thus lying
asleep in Eternity, for me to go about weeping and
wailing would be to proclaim myself ignorant of
these natural laws. Therefore I refrain."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A hunchback and a one-legged man were looking
at the tombs of departed heroes, on the K'un-lun
Mountains, where the Yellow Emperor rests. Suddenly,
ulcers broke out upon their left elbows, of a
very loathsome description.</p>

<p>"Do you loathe this?" asked the hunchback.</p>

<p>"Not I," replied the other, "why should I?
Life is a loan with which the borrower does but add
more dust and dirt to the sum total of existence.
Life and death are as day and night; and while
you and I stand gazing at the evidences of mortality
around us, if the same mortality overtakes me,
why should I loathe it?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Chuang Tzŭ one day saw an empty skull,
bleached, but still preserving its shape. Striking it
with his riding whip, he said, "Wert thou once
some ambitious citizen whose inordinate yearnings
brought him to this pass?&mdash;some statesman who
plunged his country in ruin and perished in the
fray?&mdash;some wretch who left behind him a legacy
of shame?&mdash;some beggar who died in the pangs of
hunger and cold? Or didst thou reach this state
by the natural course of old age?"</p>

<p>When he had finished speaking, he took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
skull, and placing it under his head as a pillow,
went to sleep. In the night, he dreamt that the
skull appeared to him and said, "You speak well,
Sir; but all you say has reference to the life of
mortals, and to mortal troubles. In death there
are none of these. Would you like to hear about
death?"</p>

<p>Chuang Tzŭ having replied in the affirmative, the
skull began:&mdash;"In death, there is no sovereign
above, and no subject below. The workings of the
four seasons are unknown. Our existences are
bounded only by eternity. The happiness of a king
among men cannot exceed that which we enjoy."</p>

<p>Chuang Tzŭ, however, was not convinced, and said,
"Were I to prevail upon God to allow your body
to be born again, and your bones and flesh to be
renewed, so that you could return to your parents,
to your wife, and to the friends of your youth,&mdash;would
you be willing?"</p>

<p>At this, the skull opened its eyes wide and knitted
its brows and said, "How should I cast aside
happiness greater than that of a king, and mingle
once again in the toils and troubles of mortality?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When Yen Yüan</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See p. <a href="#Page_179">179</a>.</p></div>

<p>went eastwards to the Ch'i State, Confucius was sad.
Tzŭ Kung arose and said, "Is it, Sir, because Hui</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Yen Yüan's personal name.</p></div>

<p>has gone east to Ch'i that you are sad?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"A good question," replied Confucius. "There
is a saying by Kuan Chung</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Prime Minister to Duke Huan of the Ch'i State,
7th century B.C.</p></div>

<p>of old which I highly esteem: 'Small bags won't hold
big things; short ropes won't reach down deep
wells.' Thus, destiny is a pre-arrangement, just as
form has its limitations. From neither, to neither,
can you either take away or add. And I fear lest
Hui, on his visit to the prince of Ch'i, should
preach the Tao of Yao and Shun, and dwell on the
words of Sui Jen and Shên Nung. The prince will
then search within himself, but will not find. And
not finding, he will doubt. And when a man doubts,
he will kill.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Lit.</i> "he will die." But the verb "to die" is often
used in the sense of "to make to die;" and this seems
to be the only available sense here.</p></div>

<p>"Besides, have you not heard that of old when a
sea-bird alighted outside the capital of Lu, the
prince went out to receive it, and gave it wine in the
temple, and had the <em>Chiu Shao</em></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Music composed by the legendary Emperor Shun.</p></div>

<p>played to amuse it, and a bullock slaughtered to
feed it? But the bird was dazed and too timid to
eat or drink anything; and in three days it was
dead. This was treating the bird like oneself, and
not as a bird would treat a bird. Had he treated it
as a bird would have treated a bird, he would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
put it to roost in a deep forest, to wander over a
plain, to swim in a river or lake, to feed upon fish,
to fly in order, and to settle leisurely. When the bird
was already terrified at human voices, fancy adding
music! Play the <em>Hsien Ch'ih</em></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Music of the Yellow Emperor.</p></div>

<p>or the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Chiu Shao</i> in the wilds of Tung-t'ing, and
birds will fly away, beasts will take themselves off,
and fishes will dive down below. But men will
collect to hear.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See p. <a href="#Page_244">244</a>.</p></div>

<p>"Water, which is life to fishes, is death to man.
Being differently constituted, their likes and dislikes
are different. Therefore the Sages of the
past favoured not uniformity of skill or of occupation.
Reputation was commensurate with reality;
means were adapted to the end. This was called a
due relationship with others coupled with advantage
to oneself."</p>

<p>Lieh Tzŭ, being on a journey, was eating by the
roadside, when he saw an old skull. Plucking a
blade of grass, he pointed at it and said, "Only you

no such thing as death.</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">The Secret of Life.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Argument</i>:&mdash;The soul is from God&mdash;Man's body its vehicle&mdash;The soul
quickening the body is life&mdash;Care of the internal and of the external
must be simultaneous&mdash;In due nourishment of both is <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p></div>

<p>[This chapter is supplementary to chapter iii.]</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Those</span> who understand the conditions of life
devote no attention to things which life
cannot accomplish. Those who understand the
conditions of destiny devote no attention to things
over which knowledge has no control.</p>

<p>For the due nourishment of our physical frames,
certain things are needful. Yet where such things
abound, the physical frame is not always nourished.
For the preservation of life it is necessary that there
should be no abandonment of the physical frame.
Yet where the physical frame is not abandoned, life
does not always remain.</p>

<p>Life comes, and cannot be declined. It goes, and
cannot be stopped. But alas! the world thinks
that to nourish the frame is enough to keep life.
And if indeed it is not enough, what then is the
world to do?</p>

<p>Although not enough, it must still be done. It
cannot be neglected. For if one is to neglect the
physical frame, better far to retire at once from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
world. By renouncing the world, one gets rid of
the cares of the world. The result is a natural
level, which is equivalent to a re-birth. And he who
is re-born is near.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p></div>

<p>But what inducement is there to renounce the
affairs of men, to become indifferent to life?&mdash;In
the first case, the physical body suffers no wear
and tear; in the second, the vitality is left unharmed.
And he whose physical frame is perfect
and whose vitality is in its original purity,&mdash;he is
one with God.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mens sana in corpore sano.</p></div>

<p>Heaven and earth are the father and mother of
all things. When they unite, the result is shape.
When they disperse, the original condition is renewed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As in the case of ordinary mortals.</p></div>

<p>But if body and vitality are both perfect, this state
is called <em>fit for translation</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the Biblical sense, as applied to Enoch.</p></div>

<p>Such perfection of vitality goes back to the minister
of God.</p>

<p>Lieh Tzŭ asked Kuan Yin,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>A sage who by some is said to have flourished five
or six hundred years before Lieh Tzŭ; by others,
to have been an immediate disciple of Lao Tzŭ, and
to have been entrusted by him with the publication
of the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>.</p></div>

<p>saying, "The perfect man can walk through solid
bodies without obstruction. He can pass through
fire without being burnt. He can scale the highest
heights without fear. How does he bring himself
to this?"</p>

<p>"It is because he is in a condition of absolute
purity," replied Kuan Yin. "It is not cunning
which enables him to dare such feats. Be seated,
and I will tell you.</p>

<p>"All that has form, sound, and colour, may be
classed under the head <em>thing</em>. Man differs so much
from the rest, and stands at the head of all things,
simply because the latter are but what they appear
and nothing more. But man can attain to formlessness
and vanquish death. And with that which is
in possession of the eternal, how can mere things
compare?</p>

<p>"Man may rest in the eternal fitness; he may
abide in the everlasting; and roam from the
beginning to the end of all creation. He may bring
his nature to a condition of <span class="smcap">ONE</span>; he may nourish
his strength; he may harmonize his virtue, and so
put himself into partnership with God. Then, when
his divinity is thus assured, and his spirit closed
in on all sides, how can anything find a passage
within?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He is beyond the reach of objective existences.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>"A drunken man who falls out of a cart, though
he may suffer, does not die. His bones are the
same as other people's; but he meets his accident
in a different way. His spirit is in a condition of
security. He is not conscious of riding in the cart;
neither is he conscious of falling out of it. Ideas
of life, death, fear, etc., cannot penetrate his breast;
and so he does not suffer from contact with objective
existences. And if such security is to be got from
wine, how much more is it to be got from God. It
is in God that the Sage seeks his refuge, and so he
is free from harm.</p>

<p>"An avenger does not snap in twain the murderous
weapon; neither does the most spiteful man
carry his resentment to a tile which may have hit
him on the head. And by the extension of this
principle, the empire would be at peace; no more
confusion of war, no more punishment of death.</p>

<p>"Do not develop your artificial intelligence, but
develop that intelligence which is from God. From
the latter, results virtue; from the former, cunning.
And those who do not shrink from the natural, nor
wallow in the artificial,&mdash;they are near to perfection."</p>

<p>When Confucius was on his way to the Ch'u

catching cicadas as though with his hand.</p>

<p>It is still the delight of the Chinese <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">gamin</i> to capture

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"How clever you are!" cried Confucius. "Have
you any <em>way</em> of doing this?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Way," <i>i.e.</i> road, is the primary meaning of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p></div>

<p>"I have a way," replied the hunchback. "In the
fifth and sixth moons I practise balancing two balls
one on top of the other.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At the top of his pole.</p></div>

<p>If they do not fall, I do not miss many cicadas. When
I can balance three balls, I only miss one in ten;
and when five, then it is as though I caught the
cicadas with my hand. My body is as motionless
as the stump of a tree; my arms like dead branches.
Heaven and earth and all creation may be around
me, but I am conscious only of my cicada's wings.
How should I not succeed?"</p>

<p>Confucius looked round at his disciples and said,
"Singleness of purpose induces concentration of
the faculties. Of such is the success of this hunchback."</p>

<p>Yen Yüan said to Confucius, "When I crossed

'The way of those who know how to keep you afloat
is more like sinking you. They row as if the boat
wasn't there.'</p>

<p>"I enquired what this meant, but he would not
tell me. May I ask its signification."</p>

<p>"It means," answered Confucius, "that such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
man is oblivious of the water around him. He
regards the rapid as though dry land. He looks
upon an upset as an ordinary cart accident. And if
a man can but be impervious to capsizings and
accidents in general, whither should he not be able
comfortably to go?</p>

<p>"A man who plays for counters will play well.

<p>T'ien K'ai Chih had an audience of Duke Wei of
Chou. The Duke asked him, saying, "I have
heard that Chu Hsien is studying the art of life.
As you are a companion of his, pray tell me anything
you know about it."</p>

<p>"I do but ply the broom at his outer gate,"
replied T'ien K'ai Chih; "what should I know
about my Master's researches?"</p>

<p>"Don't be so modest," said the Duke. "I am
very anxious to hear about it."</p>

<p>"Well," replied T'ien, "I have heard my master
say that keeping life is like keeping a flock of
sheep. You look out for the laggards, and whip
them up."</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" asked the Duke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the State of Lu," said T'ien, "there was a
man named Shan Pao. He lived on the mountains
and drank water. All worldly interests he had put
aside. And at the age of seventy, his complexion
was like that of a child. Unluckily, he one day fell
in with a hungry tiger who killed and ate him.</p>

<p>"There was also a man named Chang I, who
frequented the houses of rich and poor alike. At
the age of forty he was attacked by some internal
disease and died.</p>

<p>"Shan Pao took care of his inner self, and a tiger
ate his external man. Chang I took care of himself
externally, but disease attacked him internally.
These two individuals both omitted to whip up the
laggards."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is no particular record of the worthies mentioned
above.</p></div>

<p>Confucius said, "Neither affecting obscurity, nor
courting prominence, but unconsciously occupying
the happy mean,&mdash;he who can attain to these three
will enjoy a surpassing fame.</p>

<p>"In dangerous parts, where one wayfarer out of
ten meets his death, fathers and sons and brothers
will counsel each other not to travel without a sufficient
escort. Is not this wisdom? And there
where men are also greatly in danger, in the lists of
passion, in the banquet hour, not to warn them is
error indeed."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Physical precautions are not alone sufficient. Man's
moral nature equally requires constant watchfulness

<p>The Grand Augur, in his ceremonial robes,
approached the shambles and thus addressed the
pigs:&mdash;</p>

<p>"How can you object to die? I shall fatten you
for three months. I shall discipline myself for ten
days and fast for three. I shall strew fine grass, and
place you bodily upon a carved sacrificial dish.
Does not this satisfy you?"</p>

<p>Then speaking from the pigs' point of view, he
continued, "It is better perhaps after all to live on
bran and escape the shambles...."</p>

<p>"But then," added he, speaking from his own
point of view, "to enjoy honour when alive one
would readily die on a war-shield or in the headsman's
basket."</p>

<p>So he rejected the pigs' point of view and adopted
his own point of view. In what sense then was he
different from the pigs?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Even as a pig thinks of nothing but eating, so was
the Grand Augur ready to sacrifice everything, life
itself, for paltry fame.</p></div>

<p>When Duke Huan was out hunting, with Kuan
Chung as his charioteer, he saw a bogy. Catching
hold of Kuan Chung's hand, he asked him, saying,
"What do you see?"</p>

<p>"I see nothing," replied Kuan Chung. But
when the Duke got home he became delirious, and

a deficiency. When its tendency is in one direction
upwards, the result is to incline men to wrath.
When its tendency is in one direction downwards,
the result is loss of memory. When it remains
stagnant, in the middle of the body, the result is
disease."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Duke, "but are there such
things as bogies?"</p>

<p>"There are," replied Huang. "There is the mud
spirit Li; the fire spirit Kao; Lei T'ing, the spirit
of the dust-bin; P'ei O and Wa Lung, sprites of
the north-east; Yi Yang of the north-west; Wang
Hsiang of the water; the Hsin of the hills; the
K'uei of the mountain; the P'ang Huang of the

Duke.</p>

cart-wheel and as long as the shaft. It wears purple
clothes and a red cap. It is a sentient being, and
whenever it hears the rumble of thunder, it stands
up in a respectful attitude. Those who see this
bogy are like to be chieftains among men."</p>

<p>The Duke laughed exultingly and said, "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>

<p>At the end of ten days the latter asked if they were

<p>Again ten days elapsed, and the prince made a
further enquiry. "Not yet," replied Chi; "they
are still excited by the sounds and shadows of other
cocks."</p>

<p>Ten days more, and the prince asked again.
"Not yet," answered Chi; "the sight of an
enemy is still enough to excite them to rage."</p>

<p>But after another ten days, when the prince again
enquired, Chi said, "They will do. Other cocks
may crow, but they will take no notice. To look

<p>Yet Confucius saw an old man go in, and thinking
that he was suffering from some trouble and desirous
of ending his life, bade a disciple run along
the side to try and save him. The old man emerged
about a hundred paces off, and with flowing hair
went carolling along the bank. Confucius followed
him and said, "I had thought, Sir, you were a
spirit, but now I see you are a man. Kindly tell
me, is there any way to deal thus with water?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the old man; "I have no way.
There was my original condition to begin with;
then habit growing into nature; and lastly acquiescence
in destiny. Plunging in with the whirl, I
come out with the swirl. I accommodate myself
to the water, not the water to me. And so I am
able to deal with it after this fashion."</p>

<p>"What do you mean," enquired Confucius, "by
your original condition to begin with, habit growing
into nature, and acquiescence in destiny?"</p>

<p>"I was born," replied the old man, "upon dry
land, and accommodated myself to dry land. That

<p>Ch'ing, the chief carpenter,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of the Lu State.</p></div>

<p>was carving wood into a stand for hanging musical
instruments. When finished, the work appeared
to those who saw it as though of supernatural
execution. And the prince of Lu asked him, saying,
"What mystery is there in your art?"</p>

<p>"No mystery, your Highness," replied Ch'ing;
"and yet there is something.</p>

<p>"When I am about to make such a stand, I
guard against any diminution of my vital power. I
first reduce my mind to absolute quiescence. Three
days in this condition, and I become oblivious of
any reward to be gained. Five days, and I become
oblivious of any fame to be acquired. Seven days,
and I become unconscious of my four limbs and
my physical frame. Then, with no thought of the
Court present to my mind, my skill becomes concentrated,
and all disturbing elements from without
are gone. I enter some mountain forest. I search
for a suitable tree. It contains the form required,
which is afterwards elaborated. I see the stand in
my mind's eye, and then set to work. Otherwise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
there is nothing. I bring my own natural capacity
into relation with that of the wood. What was

work was due solely to this."</p>

<p>Tung Yeh Chi exhibited his charioteering skill
before Duke Chuang.</p>

Wei, which would involve an anachronism.</p></div>

<p>Backwards and forwards he drove in lines which
might have been ruled, sweeping round at each end
in curves which might have been described by
compasses.</p>

<p>The Duke, however, said that this was nothing
more than weaving; and bidding him drive round
and round a hundred times, returned home.</p>

<p>Yen Ho came upon him, and then went in and
said to the Duke, "Chi's horses are on the point of
breaking down."</p>

<p>The Duke remained silent, making no reply;
and in a short time it was announced that the
horses had actually broken down, and that Chi had
gone away.</p>

<p>"How could you tell this?" said the Duke to
Yen Ho.</p>

<p>"Because," replied the latter, "Chi was trying
to make his horses perform a task to which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
were unequal. Therefore I said they would break
down."</p>

<p>Ch'ui the artisan could draw circles with his hand

<span class="smcap">ONE</span>, and suffered no hindrance.</p>

<p>To be unconscious of one's feet implies that the
shoes are easy. To be unconscious of a waist implies

the heart is at ease. No modifications within, no

<p>A certain Sun Hsiu went to the house of Pien

I am not considered wanting in courage. Yet my

my village an outcast, I am an outlaw from my
State. How have I offended against God that he
should visit me with such a fate?"</p>

<p>"Have you not heard," replied Pien Tzŭ, "how
the perfect man conducts himself? He is oblivious
of his physical organisation. He is beyond the
reach of sight and hearing. He moves outside the
limits of this dusty world, rambling transcendentally
in the domain of no-affairs. This is called
acting but not from self-confidence, influencing but
not from authority.</p>

but without reference to it; <i>sc.</i> naturally. Influencing,
not because of authority, but gaining
authority because of natural influence.</p>

whoever may be responsible for this episode does
not say so, in chs. x. and li. of the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>.</p></div>

God? Begone!"</p>

<p>Sun Hsiu went away, and Pien Tzŭ went in and
sat down. Shortly afterwards, he looked up to
heaven and sighed; whereupon a disciple asked him
what was the matter.</p>

<p>"When Hsiu was here just now," answered Pien
Tzŭ, "I spoke to him of the virtue of the perfect
man. I fear lest he be startled and so driven on
to doubt."</p>

<p>"No, Sir," answered the disciple. "If he was
right and you were wrong, wrong will never drive
right into doubt. If, on the other hand, he was
wrong and you were right, he brought his doubt
with him, and you are not responsible."</p>

<p>"Not so," said Pien Tzŭ. "Of old, when a bird
alighted outside the capital of Lu, the prince was
delighted, and killed an ox to feed it and had the
<i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Chiu Shao</i> played to entertain it. The bird, however,
was timid and dazed and dared not to eat or
drink. This was treating the bird like oneself.
But to treat a bird as a bird would treat a bird, you
must put it to roost in a deep forest, let it swim in
river or lake, and feed at its ease on the plain.
Now Sun Hsiu is a man of small understanding;
and for me to speak to him of the perfect man is
like setting a mouse to ride in a coach or a band of
music to play to a quail. How should he not be
startled?"</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Chuang Tzŭ</span> was travelling over a mountain
when he saw a huge tree well covered with
foliage. A woodsman had stopped near by, not
caring to take it; and on Chuang Tzŭ enquiring
the reason, he was told that it was of no use.</p>

<p>"This tree," cried Chuang Tzŭ, "by virtue of
being good for nothing succeeds in completing its
allotted span."</p>

<p>When Chuang Tzŭ left the mountain, he put up
at the house of an old friend. The latter was
delighted, and ordered a servant to kill a goose and
cook it.</p>

<p>"Which shall I kill?" enquired the servant;
"the one that cackles or the one that doesn't?"</p>

<p>His master told him to kill the one which did not
cackle. And accordingly, the next day, a disciple
asked Chuang Tzŭ, saying, "Yesterday, that tree on
the mountain, because good for nothing, was to
succeed in completing its allotted span. But now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
our host's goose, which is good for nothing, has to
die. Upon which horn of the dilemma will you
rest?"</p>

<p>"I rest," replied Chuang Tzŭ with a smile,
"halfway between the two. In that position,
appearing to be what I am not, it is impossible to
avoid the troubles of mortality;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The text is here doubtful, and commentators explain
according to the fancy of each. When a Chinese
commentator does not understand his text, he
usually slurs it over. He never says "I do not
understand." Chu Fu Tzŭ alone could rise to this
height.</p></div>

<p>though, if charioted upon <span class="smcap">Tao</span> and floating far
above mortality, this would not be so. No praise,
no blame; both great and small; changing with
the change of time, but ever without special effort;
both above and below; making for harmony with
surroundings; reaching creation's First Cause;
swaying all things and swayed by none;&mdash;how
then shall such troubles come? This was the
method of Shên Nung and Huang Ti.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"If another guest had happened to arrive," says
Lin Hsi Chung, "I fancy the chance even of the
cackling goose would have been small."</p></div>

<p>"But amidst the mundane passions and relationships
of man, such would not be the case. For
where there is union, there is also separation;
where there is completion, there is also destruction;
where there is purity, there is also oppression;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
where there is honour, there is also disparagement;
where there is doing, there is also undoing; where
there is openness, there is also underhandedness;
and where there is no semblance, there is also
deceit. How then can there be any fixed point?
Alas indeed! Take note, my disciples, that such is
to be found only in the domain of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>."</p>

<p>A sage of the Ch'u State.</p></div>

<p>of Shih-nan paid a visit to the prince of Lu. The
latter wore a melancholy look; whereupon the
philosopher of Shih-nan enquired what was the
cause.</p>

<p>"I study the doctrines of the ancient Sages,"
replied the prince. "I carry on the work of my
predecessors. I respect religion. I honour the
good. Never for a moment do I relax in these
points; yet I cannot avoid misfortune, and consequently
I am sad."</p>

<p>"Your Highness' method of avoiding misfortune,"
said the philosopher of Shih-nan, "is but a
shallow one. A handsome fox or a striped leopard
will live in a mountain forest, hiding beneath some
precipitous cliff. This is their repose. They come
out at night and keep in by day. This is their
caution. Though under the stress of hunger and
thirst, they lie hidden, hardly venturing to slink
secretly to the river bank in search of food. This
is their resoluteness. Nevertheless, they do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
escape the misfortune of the net and the trap. But
what crime have they committed? 'Tis their skin

etiquette.</p>

prince. "Rivers and hills to be crossed, and I
without boat or chariot;&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p>"Unhindered by body and unfettered in mind,"
replied the philosopher, "your Highness will be a
chariot to yourself."</p>

<p>"But the road is long and dreary," argued the
prince, "and uninhabited.</p>

<p>and lessen desires," answered the philosopher,

enough. And then through river and over sea
your Highness will travel into shoreless illimitable
space. From the border-land, those who act as
escort will return; but thence onwards your Highness
will travel afar.</p>

<p>"It is the human in ourselves which is our
hindrance; and the human in others which causes
our sorrow. The great Yao had not this human
element himself, nor did he perceive it in others.

hindrance and rid yourself of this sorrow, and roam

<p>"Suppose a boat is crossing a river, and another
empty boat is about to collide with it. Even an

first time, nor even when called to three times, bad
language would inevitably follow. In the first case
there was no anger, in the second there was;

<p>"In the domain of <span class="smcap">ONE</span>," replied Shê, "there
may not be managing. I have heard say that which
is carved and polished reverts nevertheless to its
natural condition. And so I made allowances for
ignorance and for suspicion. I betrayed no feeling
when welcomed or dismissed. I forbade not those
who came, nor detained those who went away. I
showed no resentment towards the unwilling, nor
gratitude towards those who gave. Every one subscribed
what he liked; and thus in my daily
collection of subscriptions, no injury was done.&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>How

<p>The Chinese word here used for "way," as a

<p>When Confucius was hemmed in between Ch'ên
and Ts'ai, he passed seven days without food.</p>

<p>The minister Jen went to condole with him, and
said, "You were near, Sir, to death."</p>

<p>"I was indeed," replied Confucius.</p>

<p>"Do you fear death, Sir?" enquired Jen.</p>

<p>"I do," said Confucius.</p>

<p>"Then I will try to teach you," said Jen, "the

<p>"In the eastern sea there are certain birds, called
the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">i-êrh</i>. They behave themselves in a modest
and unassuming manner, as though unpossessed of
ability. They fly simultaneously: they roost in a
body. In advancing, none strives to be first; in
retreating, none ventures to be last. In eating,
none will be the first to begin; it is considered
proper to take the leavings of others. Therefore, in
their own ranks they are at peace, and the outside
world is unable to harm them. And thus they
escape trouble.</p>

<p>"Straight trees are the first felled. Sweet wells
are soonest exhausted. And you, you make a show
of your knowledge in order to startle fools. You
cultivate yourself in contrast to the degradation of
others. And you blaze along as though the sun and
moon were under your arms; consequently, you
cannot avoid trouble.</p>

<p>"Formerly, I heard a very wise man say, Self-praise
is no recommendation. In merit achieved
there is deterioration. In fame achieved there is
loss. Who can discard both merit and fame and
become one with the rest? <span class="smcap">Tao</span> pervades all things

In its purity and constancy, it may be compared
with the purposeless. Remaining concealed,
rejecting power, it works not for merit nor for
fame. Thus, not censuring others, it is not censured
by others.</p>

<p>"And if the perfect man cares not for fame, why,
Sir, should you take pleasure in it?"</p>

<p>"Good indeed!" replied Confucius; and forthwith
he took leave of his friends and dismissed his
disciples and retired to the wilds, where he dressed
himself in skins and serge and fed on acorns and
chestnuts. He passed among the beasts and birds
and they took no heed of him. And if so, how much
more among men?</p>

<p>Confucius asked Tzŭ Sang Hu,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See <a href="#Page_68">ch. vi</a>.</p></div>

<p>saying, "I have been twice expelled from Lu. My
tree was cut down in Sung. I have been tabooed
in Wei. I am a failure in Shang and Chou. I
was surrounded between Ch'ên and Ts'ai. And in
addition to all these troubles, my friends have
separated from me and my disciples are gone. How
is this?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See p. <a href="#Page_180">180</a>.</p></div>

<p>"Have you not heard," replied Sang Hu, "how
when the men of Kuo fled, one of them, named Lin
Hui, cast aside most valuable regalia and carried
away his child upon his back? Some one suggested
that he was influenced by the value of the child;&mdash;but
the child's value was small. Or by the inconvenience
of the regalia;&mdash;but the inconvenience of
the child would be much greater. Why then did
he leave behind the regalia and carry off the
child?</p>

<p>"Lin Hui himself said, 'The regalia involved
a mere question of money. The child was from
God.'</p>

<p>"And so it is that in trouble and calamity mere
money questions are neglected, while we ever cling
nearer to that which is from God. And between
neglecting and clinging to, the difference is great.</p>

<p>"The friendship of the superior man is negative
like water. The friendship of the mean man is
full-flavoured like wine. That of the superior man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
passes from the negative to the affectionate. That
of the mean man passes from the full-flavoured to
nothing. The friendship of the mean man begins
without due cause, and in like manner comes to an
end.</p>

<p>"I hear and obey," replied Confucius; and
forthwith he went quietly home, put an end to his
studies and cast aside his books. His disciples no
longer saluted him as teacher; but his love for them
deepened every day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On another occasion, Sang Hu said to him again,
"When Shun was about to die, he commanded the
Great Yü as follows:&mdash;Be careful. Act in accordance
with your physical body. Speak in accordance
with your feelings. You will thus not get into
difficulty with the former nor suffer annoyance in
the latter. And as under these conditions you will
not stand in need of outward embellishment of any
kind, it follows that you therefore will not stand in
need of anything."</p>

<p>"How miserable you look, Sir!" cried the prince.</p>

<p>"It is poverty, not misery," replied Chuang Tzŭ.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
"A man who has <span class="smcap">Tao</span> cannot be miserable.
Ragged clothes and old boots make poverty, not

difficulty, but because it is at a disadvantage as
regards position, and is unable to make use of its
skill. And how should any one, living under
foolish sovereigns and wicked ministers, help being
miserable, even though he might wish not to be so?</p>

<p>"It was under such circumstances that Pi Kan
was disembowelled."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Confucius was hemmed in between Ch'ên
and Ts'ai and had gone seven days without food,
then, holding in his left hand a piece of dry wood
and in his right hand a dry stick, he sang a ballad
of Piao Shih.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An ancient ruler.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>He had an instrument, but the gamut was wanting.
There was sound, but no tune. The sound of the
wood accompanied by the voice of the man yielded
a harsh result, but it was in keeping with the
feelings of his audience.</p>

<p>Yen Hui, who was standing by in a respectful
attitude, thereupon began to turn his eyes about
him; and Confucius, fearing lest he should be
driven by exaltation into bragging, or by a desire
for safety into sorrow,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As a result of hearing the song.</p></div>

<p>spoke to him as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hui! it is easy to escape injury from God; it
is difficult to avoid the benefits of man. There is
no beginning and there is no end. Man and God
are <span class="smcap">ONE</span>. Who then was singing just now?"</p>

<p>"Pray, Sir, what do you mean," asked Yen Hui,
"by saying that it is easy to escape injury from
God?"</p>

<p>"Hunger, thirst, cold, and heat," replied Confucius,
"are but as fetters in the path of life. They
belong to the natural laws which govern the universe;
and in obedience thereto I pass on my
allotted course. The subject dares not disregard
the mandates of his prince. And if this is man's
duty to man, how much more shall it be his duty to
God?"</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of difficult to avoid the
benefits of man?" asked Yen Hui.</p>

<p>"If one begins," replied Confucius, "by adapta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>tion
to surroundings, rank and power follow without
cease. Such advantages are external; they are not
derived from oneself. And my life is more or less
dependent upon the external. The superior man
does not steal these; nor does the good man pilfer
them. What then do I but take them as they
come?</p>

<p>"Therefore it has been said that no bird is so
wise as the swallow. If it sees a place unfit to
dwell in, it will not bestow a glance thereon; and
even though it should drop food there, it will leave
the food and fly away. Now swallows fear man.
Yet they dwell among men. Because there they find
their natural abode."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the same way, man should adapt himself to the
conditions which surround him.</p></div>

<p>"And what is the meaning," enquired Yen Hui,
"of no beginning and no end?"</p>

<p>"The work goes on," replied Confucius, "and
no man knoweth the cause. How then shall he
know the end, or the beginning? There is nothing
left to us but to wait."</p>

<p>"And that man and God are <span class="smcap">One</span>," said Yen
Hui. "What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"That man is," replied Confucius, "is from God.
That God is, is also from God. That man is not
God, is his nature.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Sc.</i> that which makes him man.</p></div>

<p>When Chuang Tzŭ was wandering in the park
at Tiao-ling, he saw a strange bird which came from
the south. Its wings were seven feet across. Its
eyes were an inch in circumference. And it flew
close past Chuang Tzŭ's head to alight in a chestnut
grove.</p>

<p>"What manner of bird is this?" cried Chuang
Tzŭ. "With strong wings it does not fly away.
With large eyes it does not see."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Or it would not have flown so near.</p></div>

<p>So he picked up his skirts and strode towards it
with his cross-bow, anxious to get a shot. Just
then he saw a cicada enjoying itself in the shade,
forgetful of all else. And he saw a mantis spring
and seize it, forgetting in the act its own body,
which the strange bird immediately pounced upon
and made its prey. And this it was which had
caused the bird to forget its own nature.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And approach so close to man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This episode has been widely popularised in Chinese
every-day life. Its details have been expressed
pictorially in a roughly-executed woodcut, with the
addition of a tiger about to spring upon the man,
and a well into which both will eventually tumble.
A legend at the side reads,&mdash;"All is Destiny!"</p></div>

<p>"Alas!" cried Chuang Tzŭ with a sigh, "how
creatures injure one another. Loss follows the
pursuit of gain."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Those who would prey on others are preyed upon
in turn themselves.</p></div>

<p>So he laid aside his bow and went home, driven
away by the park-keeper who wanted to know what
business he had there.</p>

<p>For three months after this, Chuang Tzŭ did not
leave the house; and at length Lin Chü</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A disciple.</p></div>

<p>asked him, saying, "Master, how is it that you
have not been out for so long?"</p>

<p>"While keeping my physical frame," replied
Chuang Tzŭ, "I lost sight of my real self. Gazing
at muddy water, I lost sight of the clear abyss.
Besides, I have learnt from the Master as follows:&mdash;"When
you go into the world, follow its
customs."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This saying is attributed, in uncanonical works, to
Confucius. But if any one was "Master" to Chuang
Tzŭ, it would of course be Lao Tzŭ.</p></div>

<p>Now when I strolled into the park at Tiao-ling, I
forgot my real self. That strange bird which flew
close past me to the chestnut grove, forgot its
nature. The keeper of the chestnut grove took
me for a thief. Consequently I have not been
out."</p>

<p>went to the Sung State, he passed a night at an
inn.</p>

<p>The innkeeper had two concubines, one beautiful,
the other ugly. The latter he loved; the former,
he hated.</p>

<p>Yang Tzŭ asked how this was; whereupon one
of the inn servants said, "The beautiful one is so
conscious of her beauty that one does not think
her beautiful. The ugly one is so conscious of
her ugliness that one does not think her ugly."</p>

<p>He kept on praising Ch'i Kung, until at length
Prince Wên said, "Is Ch'i Kung your tutor?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Tzŭ Fang; "he is merely a
neighbour. He discourses admirably upon <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.
That is why I praise him."</p>

<p>"Have you then no tutor?" enquired the Prince.</p>

<p>"I have," replied Tzŭ Fang.</p>

<p>"And who may he be?" said Prince Wên.</p>

<p>"Tung Kuo Shun Tzŭ," answered Tzŭ Fang.</p>

<p>"Then how is it you do not praise him?" asked
the Prince.</p>

<p>"He is perfect," replied Tzŭ Fang. "In appearance,
a man; in reality, God. Unconditioned
himself, he falls in with the conditioned, to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
own greater glory. Pure himself, he can still
tolerate others. If men are without <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, by a
mere look he calls them to a sense of error, and
causes their intentions to melt away. How could
I praise him?"</p>

<p>Thereupon Tzŭ Fang took his leave, and the
Prince remained for the rest of the day absorbed
in silence. At length he called an officer in waiting
and said, "How far beyond us is the man of perfect
virtue! Hitherto I have regarded the discussion
of holiness and wisdom, and the practice of charity
and duty to one's neighbour, as the utmost point
attainable. But now that I have heard of Tzŭ
Fang's tutor, my body is relaxed and desires not
movement, my mouth is closed and desires not

A certain man of Lu begged for an interview, but
Wên Po Hsüeh Tzŭ said, "No. I have heard that
the gentlemen of the Middle Kingdom are experts
in ceremonies and obligations, but wanting in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>

see him."</p>

<p>So he went on to Ch'i; but once more at Lu,
on his way home, the same man again begged to
have an interview.</p>

<p>"When I was last here," cried Wên Po Hsüeh
Tzŭ, "he asked to see me, and now again he asks
to see me. Surely he must have something to
communicate."</p>

<p>Whereupon he went and received the stranger,
and on returning gave vent to sighs. Next day
he received him again, and again after the interview
gave vent to sighs. Then his servant asked
him, saying, "How is it that whenever you receive
this stranger, you always sigh afterwards?"</p>

<p>"I have already told you," replied Wên Po Hsüeh
Tzŭ, "that the people of the Middle Kingdom
are experts in ceremonies and obligations but
wanting in knowledge of the human heart. The
man who visited me came in and went out as <em>per</em>
compasses and square. His demeanour was now
that of the dragon, now that of the tiger. He
criticised me as though he had been my son. He
admonished me as though he had been my father.
Therefore I gave vent to sighs."</p>

<p>When Confucius saw Wên Po Hsüeh Tzŭ, the
former did not utter a word. Whereupon Tzŭ Lu

When you gallop, I gallop. But when you dash
beyond the bounds of mortality, I can only stand
staring behind. How is this?"</p>

<p>"I mean," continued Yen Yüan, "that as you

preach <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, so I preach <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. And by 'when you

you make people believe you, without striving you

you gather people around you. I cannot
understand how this is so."</p>

death of the body is of but secondary importance.</p>

First Cause, but we never see his form. His report
fills space. There is darkness and light. Days
come and months go. Work is being constantly
performed, yet we never witness the performance.
Life must bring us from somewhere, and death
must carry us back. Beginning and end follow
ceaselessly one upon the other, and we cannot say
when the series will be exhausted. If this is not
the work of a First Cause, what is it?"</p>

<p>"Kindly explain," said Confucius, "what is to
be got by wandering as you said."</p>

<p>"The result," answered Lao Tzŭ, "is perfect
goodness and perfect happiness. And he who has
these is a perfect man."</p>

<p>"And by what means," enquired Confucius,
"can this be attained?"</p>

<p>"Animals," said Lao Tzŭ, "that eat grass do
not mind a change of pasture. Creatures that live
in water do not mind a change of pond. A slight
change may be effected so long as the essential is
untouched.</p>

<p>"Joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, find no place
in that man's breast; for to him all creation is
<span class="smcap">One</span>. And all things being thus united in <span class="smcap">One</span>,
his body and limbs are but as dust of the earth,
and life and death, beginning and end, are but as
night and day, and cannot destroy his peace. How
much less such trifles as gain or loss, misfortune
or good fortune?</p>

<p>"He rejects rank as so much mud. For he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
knows that if a man is of honourable rank, the
honour is in himself, and cannot be lost by change
of condition, nor exhausted by countless modifications
of existence. Who then can grieve his heart?
Those who practise <span class="smcap">Tao</span> understand the secret of
this."</p>

<p>"Master," said Confucius, "your virtue equals
that of Heaven and Earth; yet you still employ
perfect precepts in the cultivation of your heart.
Who among the sages of old could have uttered
such words?"</p>

<p>"Not so," answered Lao Tzŭ. "The fluidity
of water is not the result of any effort on the part
of the water, but is its natural property. And the
virtue of the perfect man is such that even without
cultivation there is nothing which can withdraw
from his sway. Heaven is naturally high, the earth
is naturally solid, the sun and moon are naturally
bright. Do they cultivate these attributes?"</p>

<p>Confucius went forth and said to Yen Hui,</p>

<p>"In point of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, I am but as an animalcule in
vinegar. Had not the Master opened my eyes, I
should not have perceived the vastness of the
universe."</p>

<p>When Chuang Tzŭ was at an interview with
Duke Ai of Lu,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Who had then been dead 120 years.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>the latter said, "We have many scholars, Sir, in
Lu, but few of your school."</p>

<p>"In Lu," replied Chuang Tzŭ, "there are but
few scholars."</p>

<p>"Look at the number who wear scholars' robes,"
said the Duke. "How can you say they are few?"</p>

<p>"Scholars who wear round hats," answered
Chuang Tzŭ, "know the seasons of Heaven.
Scholars who wear square shoes know the shape
of Earth.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>According to ancient Chinese cosmogony, "Heaven
is round: Earth is square."</p></div>

<p>And scholars who loosely gird themselves are
ready to decide whatever questions may arise. But
scholars who have <span class="smcap">Tao</span> do not necessarily wear
robes; neither does the wearing of robes necessarily
mean that a scholar has <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. If your Highness
does not think so, why not issue an order through
the Middle Kingdom, making death the punishment
for all who wear the robes without having
the <span class="smcap">Tao</span>?"</p>

<p>Thereupon Duke Ai circulated this mandate for
five days, the result being that not a single man in
Lu dared to don scholars' robes,&mdash;with the exception
of one old man who, thus arrayed, took his
stand at the Duke's gate.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My Ming editor (a priest) says this was Confucius

<p>The Duke summoned him to the presence, and
asked him many questions on politics, trying to
entangle him, but in vain. Then Chuang Tzŭ said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
"If there is only one scholar in Lu, surely that is
not many."</p>

<p>When Wên Wang was on a tour of inspection
in Tsang, he saw an old man fishing. But his
fishing was not real fishing, for he did not fish to
catch fish, but to amuse himself.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Wherefore, from the standpoint of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, he was
the more likely to succeed.</p></div>

<p>So Wên Wang wished to employ him in the
administration of government, but feared lest his
own ministers, uncles, and brothers, might object.
On the other hand, if he let the old man go, he
could not bear to think of the people being deprived
of such an influence.</p>

<p>Accordingly, that very morning he informed his
ministers, saying, "I once dreamt that a Sage of
a black colour and with a large beard, riding upon
a parti-coloured horse with red stockings on one
side, appeared and instructed me to place the administration
in the hands of the old gentleman of
Tsang, promising that the people would benefit
greatly thereby."</p>

<p>The ministers at once said, "It is a command
from your Highness' father."</p>

<p>"I think so," answered Wên Wang. "But let
us try by divination."</p>

<p>"It is a command from your Highness' late
father," said the ministers, "and may not be disobeyed.
What need for divination?"</p>

<p>So the old man of Tsang was received and
entrusted with the administration. He altered
none of the existing statutes. He issued no unjust
regulations. And when, after three years, Wên<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Wang made another inspection, he found all
dangerous organisations broken up, the officials
doing their duty as a matter of course, while the
use of measures of grain was unknown within the
four boundaries of the State. There was thus
unanimity in the public voice, singleness of official
purpose, and identity of interests to all.</p>

<p>So Wên Wang appointed the old man Grand
Tutor; and then, standing with his face to the north,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An attitude of respect. Facing the south was the
conventional position of a ruler.</p></div>

<p>asked him, saying, "Can such government be
extended over the empire?"</p>

<p>The old man of Tsang was silent and made no
reply. He then abruptly took leave, and by the
evening of that same day had disappeared, never
to be heard of again.</p>

<p>Yen Yüan said to Confucius, "If Wên Wang
was unable to do this of himself, how was he able
to do it by a dream?"</p>

<p>"Silence!" cried Confucius: "It is not for you
to criticise Wên Wang who succeeded in fulfilling
his mission. The dream was merely to satisfy the
vulgar mind."</p>

a cup of water on his elbow and began to let fly.
Hardly was one arrow out of sight ere another was
on the string, the archer standing all the time like
a statue.</p>

<p>"But this is shooting under ordinary conditions,"
cried Po Hun Wu Jên; "it is not shooting under
extraordinary conditions. Now I will ascend a
high mountain with you, and stand on the edge of
a precipice a thousand feet in height, and see how
you can shoot then."</p>

<p>Thereupon Wu Jên went with Lieh Tzŭ up a
high mountain, and stood on the edge of a precipice
a thousand feet in height, approaching it backwards

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sir, you have been three times called to office
without showing any elation, and you have been
three times dismissed without displaying any
chagrin. At first, I doubted you; but now I notice
that your breathing is perfectly regular. How do
you manage thus to control your emotions?"</p>

<p>"I am no better than other people," replied
Sun Shu Ao. "I regard office when it comes as
something which may not be declined; when it
goes, as something which cannot be kept. To
me both the getting and losing are outside my
own self; and therefore I feel no chagrin. How
am I better than other people?</p>

<p>"Besides, I am not conscious of office being
either in the hands of others or in my own. If
it is in the hands of others, my own personality
disappears; if in mine, theirs. And amidst the
cares of deliberation and investigation, what
leisure has one for troubling about rank?"</p>

<p>When Confucius heard this, he said, "The perfect
Sages of old!&mdash;cunning men could not defeat
them; beautiful women could not seduce them;
robbers could not steal from them;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They were unmoved in the face of danger.</p></div>

<p>Fu Hsi and the Yellow Emperor could not make
friends of them. Life and death are great; yet
these gave them no pang.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That would cause them to sacrifice truth.</p></div>

<p>How much less then rank and power!</p>

<p>"The souls of such men pierced through huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
mountains as though they had been nothing;
descended into the abyss without getting wet;
occupied lowly stations without chagrin. They
filled the whole universe; and the more they gave
to others, the more they had themselves."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These last words occur in chapter lxxxi. of the
<cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>. It is, to say the least, strange to
find them here in the mouth of Confucius without
a hint as to their alleged Taoistic source.</p>

Prince of Fan, "did not suffice to injure my
existence.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Which was already, by virtue of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, beyond the
reach of mundane influences.</p></div>

<p>And while the destruction of the Fan State did
not suffice to injure my existence, the preservation
of the Ch'u State will not be enough to preserve
yours.</p>

<p>[This chapter is supplementary to chapter vi.]</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">When</span> Knowledge travelled north, across the
Black Water, and over the Dark-Steep
Mountain, he met Do-nothing Say-nothing and
asked of him as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Kindly tell me by what thoughts, by what
cogitations, may <span class="smcap">Tao</span> be known? By resting in
what, by according in what, may <span class="smcap">Tao</span> be approached?
By following what, by pursuing what,
may <span class="smcap">Tao</span> be attained?"</p>

<p>To these three questions, Do-nothing Say-nothing
returned no answer. Not that he would
not answer, but that he could not. So when
Knowledge got no reply, he turned round and went
off to the south of the White Water and up the
Ku-chüeh Mountain, where he saw All-in-extremes,
and to him he put the same questions.</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried All-in-extremes, "I know. I will
tell you...."</p>

<p>But just as he was about to speak he forgot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
what he wanted to say. So when Knowledge got
no reply, he went back to the palace and asked
the Yellow Emperor. The latter said, "By no
thoughts, by no cogitations, <span class="smcap">Tao</span> may be known.
By resting in nothing, by according in nothing,
<span class="smcap">Tao</span> may be approached. By following nothing,
by pursuing nothing, <span class="smcap">Tao</span> may be attained."</p>

<p>Then Knowledge said to the Yellow Emperor,
"Now you and I know this, but those two know
it not. Who is right?"</p>

<p>"Of those two," replied the Yellow Emperor,
"Do-nothing Say-nothing is genuinely right, and
All-in-extremes is near. You and I are wholly
wrong. Those who understand it do not speak
about it, those who speak about it do not understand
it.</p>

<p>These words occur in the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>, ch. vi.
See also <i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_170">170</a>.</p></div>

<p>Therefore the Sage teaches a doctrine which does
not find expression in words.</p>

<p>"Therefore it has been said, 'If <span class="smcap">Tao</span> perishes,
then <span class="smcap">Tê</span> will perish. If <span class="smcap">Tê</span> perishes, then charity
will perish. If charity perishes, then duty to one's

are but a showy ornament of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, while oft-times
the source of trouble.'</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The above is from the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>, ch. xxxviii.
It is interesting to note how the Yellow Emperor
annihilates time by quoting a work not written until
many centuries after his date.</p></div>

<p>"Therefore it has been said, 'Those who practise
<span class="smcap">Tao</span> suffer daily loss. If that loss proceeds
until inaction ensues, then by that very inaction
there is nothing which cannot be done.'</p>

<p>"Now, we are already beings. And if we desire
to revert to our original condition, how difficult
that is! 'Tis a change to which only the greatest
among us are equal.</p>

<p>"Life follows upon death. Death is the beginning
of life. Who knows when the end is reached?
The life of man results from convergence of the
vital fluid. Its convergence is life; its dispersion,
death. If then life and death are but consecutive
states, what need have I to complain?</p>

<p>"Therefore all things are <span class="smcap">One</span>. What we love
is animation. What we hate is corruption. But
corruption in its turn becomes animation, and
animation once more becomes corruption.</p>

by a single vital fluid, and Sages accordingly
venerate <span class="smcap">One</span>."</p>

<p>Then Knowledge said to the Yellow Emperor,
"I asked Do-nothing Say-nothing, but he did not
answer me. Not that he, would not; he could
not. So I asked All-in-extremes. He was just
going to tell me, but he did not tell me. Not
that he would not; but just as he was going to
do so, he forgot what he wanted to say. Now I
ask you, and you tell me. How then are you
wholly wrong?"</p>

<p>"Of those two," replied the Yellow Emperor,
"the former was genuinely right, inasmuch as he
did not <em>know</em>. The latter was near, inasmuch as
he <em>forgot</em>. You and I are wholly wrong, inasmuch
as we <em>know</em>."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Tao</span> is attained, not by knowledge, but by absence

<p>When All-in-extremes heard of this, he considered
that the Yellow Emperor had spoken
well.</p>

<p>The universe is very beautiful, yet it says
nothing. The four seasons abide by a fixed
law, yet they are not heard. All creation is
based upon absolute principles, yet nothing
speaks.</p>

<p>And the true Sage, taking his stand upon the
beauty of the universe, pierces the principles of
created things. Hence the saying that the per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>fect
man does nothing, the true Sage performs
nothing, beyond gazing at the universe.</p>

<p>The Empyrean repeated these words to No-beginning,

of Without-end or the knowledge of Inaction.</p>

<p>"Not to know," replied No-beginning, "is profound.
To know is shallow. Not to know is
internal. To know is external."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

your natural intelligence. Your confusion of to-day
results from the intrusion of something other than
the natural intelligence.</p>

"That will do. Do not reply. If life did
not give birth to death, and if death did not put an
end to life, surely life and death would be no longer
correlates, but would each exist independently.
What there was before the universe, was <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. <span class="smcap">Tao</span>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Argument</i>:&mdash;The operation of <span class="smcap">Tao</span> is not seen&mdash;Spheres of action vary&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tao</span>
remains the same&mdash;Spontaneity essential&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tao</span> can be divided

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Among</span> the disciples of Lao Tzŭ was one
named Kêng Sang Ch'u. He alone had
attained to the <span class="smcap">Tao</span> of his Master. He lived up
north, on the Wei-lei Mountains. Of his attendants,
he dismissed those who were systematically clever
or conventionally charitable. The useless remained
with him; the incompetent served him. And in
three years the district of Wei-lei was greatly
benefited.</p>

<p>One of the inhabitants said in conversation,
"When Mr. Kêng Sang first came among us, we
did not know what to make of him. Now, we could
not say enough about him in a day, and even a
year would leave something unsaid. Surely he must
be a true Sage. Why not pray to him as to the
spirits, and honour him as a tutelary god of the
land?"</p>

<p>On hearing of this, Kêng Sang Ch'u turned his
face to the south</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Towards the abode of Lao Tzŭ.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>in shame, at which his disciples were astonished.
But Kêng Sang said, "What cause have you for
astonishment? The influence of spring quickens the
life of plants, and autumn brings them to maturity.
In the absence of any agent, how is this so? It is
the operation of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p>

<p>"I have heard that the perfect man may be pent
up like a corpse in a tomb, yet the people will become
unartificial and without care.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>So powerful will be his influence.</p></div>

<p>But now these poor people of Wei-lei wish to exalt
me among their wise and good. Surely then I am
but a shallow vessel; and therefore I was shamed
for the doctrine of Lao Tzŭ."</p>

<p>The disciples said, "Not so. In a sixteen-foot
ditch a big fish has not room to turn round; but
'tis the very place for an eel. On a six or seven-foot
hillock a large beast finds no shelter, while the uncanny
fox gladly makes its lair therein. Besides,
ever since the days of Yao and Shun it has always
been customary to honour the virtuous, advance
the able, give precedence to the good and useful.
Why not then among the people of Wei-lei? Let
them do it, Sir."</p>

<p>"Come here, my children," said Kêng Sang
Ch'u. "A beast big enough to swallow a cart, if it
wanders alone from the hills, will not escape the
sorrow of the snare. A fish big enough to gulp
down a boat, if stranded on the dry shore will become
a prey to ants. Therefore it is that birds and beasts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
love height, and fishes and turtles love depth. And
the man who cares for himself hides his body. He
loves the occult.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is a play here upon words.</p></div>

<p>"As to Yao and Shun, what claim have they to
praise? Their fine distinctions simply amounted to
knocking a hole in a wall in order to stop it up with
brambles;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They had better have left the wall alone.</p></div>

<p>to combing each individual hair; to counting the
grains for a rice pudding! How in the name of
goodness did they profit their generation?</p>

<p>"If the virtuous are honoured, emulation will
ensue. If knowledge be fostered, the result will
be theft.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>People will employ their knowledge against each
other.</p></div>

<p>These things are of no use to make people good.
The struggle for wealth is so severe. Sons murder
their fathers; ministers their princes; men rob in
broad daylight, and bore through walls at high
noon. I tell you that the root of this great evil is
from Yao and Shun, and that its branches will
extend into a thousand ages to come. A thousand
ages hence, man will be feeding upon man!"</p>

<p>Nan Yung Ch'u</p>

<div class="blockquot">

one of my age to do that he may attain to this?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>"Preserve your form complete," said Kêng Sang,
"your vitality secure. Let no anxious thoughts
intrude. And then in three years' space you may
attain to this."</p>

<p>"I do not know," said Nan Yung, "that there is
any difference in the form of eyes; yet blind men
cannot see. I do not know that there is any
difference in the form of ears; yet deaf men cannot
hear. I do not know that there is any difference in
the form of hearts;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The seat of the intellect.</p></div>

<p>yet fools cannot use theirs to any purpose. The
forms are alike; yet there is something which
differentiates them. One will succeed, and another
will not. Yet you tell me to preserve my form
complete, my vitality secure, and let no anxious
thoughts intrude. But so far I only hear <span class="smcap">Tao</span> with
my ears."</p>

<p>"Well said!" cried Kêng Sang; and then he
added, "Small wasps cannot transform huge
caterpillars.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>According to Chinese notions, the wasp has no
young. It transforms a small caterpillar into the
required offspring.</p></div>

<p>Bantams cannot hatch the eggs of geese. The fowls
of Lu can. Not that there is any difference in the
hatching power of chickens. One can and another
cannot, because one is naturally fitted for working
on a large, the other on a small scale. My talents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
are of the latter order. I cannot transform you.
Why not go south and see Lao Tzŭ?"</p>

<p>So Nan Yung took some provisions, and after a
seven days' journey arrived at the abode of Lao Tzŭ.</p>

<p>"Have you come from Kêng Sang Ch'u?" said
the latter.</p>

<p>"I have," replied Nan Yung.</p>

<p>"But why," said Lao Tzŭ, "bring all these people
with you?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Meaning the questions he was going to ask.</p></div>

<p>Nan Yung looked back in alarm, and Lao Tzŭ
continued, "Do you not understand what I say?"</p>

<p>Nan Yung bent his head abashed, and then
looking up, said with a sigh, "I have now forgotten
how to answer, in consequence of missing what I
came to ask."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He was so confused by Lao Tzŭ's question coming
before he had had time to state his mission.</p></div>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Lao Tzŭ.</p>

<p>"If I do not know," replied Nan Yung, "men
call me a fool. If I do know, I injure myself. If I
am not charitable, I injure others. If I am, I injure
myself. If I do not do my duty to my neighbour,
I injure others. If I do it, I injure myself. My
trouble lies in not seeing how to escape from these
three dilemmas. On the strength of my connection
with Kêng Sang, I would venture to ask advice."</p>

<p>"When I saw you," said Lao Tzŭ, "I knew in
the twinkling of an eye what was the matter with
you. And now what you say confirms my view.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
You are confused, as a child that has lost its
parents. You would fathom the sea with a pole.
You are astray. You are struggling to get back to
your natural self, but cannot find the way. Alas!
alas!"</p>

<p>Nan Yung begged to be allowed to remain, and
set to work to cultivate the good and eliminate the
evil within him. At the expiration of ten days,
with sorrow in his heart, he again sought Lao Tzŭ.</p>

<p>"Have you thoroughly cleansed yourself?" said
Lao Tzŭ. "But this grieved look.... There is
some evil obstruction yet.</p>

<p>"If the disturbances are external,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Sc.</i> sensual.</p></div>

<p>do not be always combating them, but close the
channels to the mind. If the disturbances are
internal, do not strive to oppose them, but close all
entrance from without.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And the mind will recover itself.</p></div>

<p>If the disturbances are both internal and external,
then you will not even be able to hold fast to Tao,
still less practise it."</p>

<p>"If a rustic is sick," said Nan Yung, "and
another rustic goes to see him; and if the sick man
can say what is the matter with him,&mdash;then he is
not seriously ill. Yet my search after <span class="smcap">Tao</span> is like
swallowing drugs which only increase the malady.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Although really not so very far from <span class="smcap">Tao</span> (<i>sc.</i> health)
as evidenced by my being able to describe my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
complaint, which a man sick of some serious disease
is scarcely able to do.</p></div>

<p>I beg therefore merely to ask the art of preserving
life."</p>

<p>"The art of preserving life," replied Lao Tzŭ,
"consists in being able to keep all in <span class="smcap">One</span>,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Sc.</i> Body and soul. See the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>, ch. x,
where this idea has been reproduced.</p></div>

<p>to lose nothing, to estimate good and evil without
divination,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To know that each is bound up in the other.</p></div>

<p>to know when to stop, and how much is enough, to
leave others alone and attend to oneself, to be without
cares and without knowledge,&mdash;to be in fact as
a child. A child will cry all day and not become
hoarse, because of the perfection of its constitutional
harmony.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Also reproduced in the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>, ch. lv.</p></div>

<p>It will keep its fist tightly closed all day and not
open it, because of the concentration of its virtue.
It will gaze all day without taking off its eyes,
because its sight is not attracted by externals. In
motion, it knows not whither it is bound; at rest,
it is not conscious of doing anything; but unconsciously
adapts itself to the exigencies of its environment.
This is the art of preserving life."</p>

<p>"Is this then the virtue of the perfect man?"
cried Nan Yung.</p>

<p>"Not so," said Lao Tzŭ. "I am, as it were, but
breaking the ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>"The perfect man shares the food of this earth,
but the happiness of God. He does not incur
trouble either from men or things. He does not
join in censuring, in plotting, in toadying. Free
from care he comes, and unconscious he goes;&mdash;this
is the art of preserving life."</p>

<p>"This then is perfection?" inquired Nan
Yung.</p>

<p>"Not yet," said Lao Tzŭ. "I specially asked
if you could be as a child. A child acts without
knowing what it does; moves without knowing
whither. Its body is like a dry branch; its heart
like dead ashes. Thus, good and evil fortune find
no lodgment therein; and there where good and
evil fortune are not, how can the troubles of mortality
be?</p>

<p>"Those whose hearts are in a state of repose
give forth a divine radiance, by the light of which
they see themselves as they are. And only by
cultivating such repose can man attain to the
constant.</p>

<p>"Those who are constant are sought after by
men and assisted by God. Those who are sought
after by men are the people of God; those who are
assisted by God are his chosen children.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The stuff of which rulers are made.</p></div>

<p>"To study this is to study what cannot be
learnt. To practise this is to practise what cannot
be accomplished. To discuss this is to discuss
what can never be proved. Let knowledge stop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
at the unknowable. That is perfection. And for
those who do not follow this, God will destroy
them!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Knowledge," says Emerson in his <cite>Montaigne, or
the Sceptic</cite>, "is the knowing that we cannot know."</p></div>

<p>"With such defences for the body, ever prepared
for the unexpected, deferential to the rights of
others,&mdash;if then calamities overtake you, these are
from God, not from man. Let them not disturb
what you have already achieved. Let them not
penetrate into the soul's abode. For there resides
the Will. And if the will knows not what to will,
it will not be able to will.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Inability to exercise the functions of will is <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p></div>

<p>"Whatsoever is not said in all sincerity, is
wrongly said. And not to be able to rid oneself
of this vice is only to sink deeper towards perdition.</p>

<p>"Those who do evil in the open light of day,&mdash;men
will punish them. Those who do evil in
secret,&mdash;God will punish them. Who fears both
man and God, he is fit to walk alone.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The term here used for "God" means strictly those
"spirits" which are the avenging emissaries of the
Deity.</p></div>

<p>Those who are devoted to the internal,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To self-culture.</p></div>

<p>in practice acquire no reputation. Those who are
devoted to the external, strive for pre-eminence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
among their fellows. Practice without reputation
throws a halo around the meanest. But he who
strives for pre-eminence among his fellows, he is as
a huckster whose weariness all perceive though he
himself puts on an air of gaiety.</p>

<p>"He who is naturally in sympathy with man, to
him all men come. But he who forcedly adapts,
has no room even for himself, still less for others.
And he who has no room for others, has no ties.
It is all over with him.</p>

<p>"There is no weapon so deadly as man's will.
Excalibur is second to it. There is no bandit so
powerful as Nature.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The interaction of the Positive and Negative principles,
which produces the visible universe.</p></div>

<p>In the whole universe there is no escape from it.
Yet it is not Nature which does the injury. It is
man's own heart.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Tao</span> informs its own subdivisions, their successes
and their failures. What is feared in subdivision
is separation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From the parent stock of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p></div>

<p>What is feared in separation, is further separation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>So that all connection is severed.</p></div>

<p>Thus, to issue forth without return, this is development
of the supernatural. To issue forth and
attain the goal, this is called death. To be annihilated
and yet to exist, this is convergence of the
supernatural into <span class="smcap">One</span>. To make things which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
have form appear to all intents and purposes formless,&mdash;this
is the sum of all things.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Man's final triumph over matter.</p></div>

<p>"Birth is not a beginning; death is not an end.
There is existence without limitation; there is
continuity without a starting-point. Existence
without limitation is <em>Space</em>. Continuity without
a starting-point is <em>Time</em>. There is birth, there is
death, there is issuing forth, there is entering in.
That through which one passes in and out without
seeing its form, that is the Portal of God.</p>

<p>"The Portal of God is Non-Existence. All
things sprang from Non-Existence. Existence
could not make existence existence. It must have
proceeded from Non-Existence,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The idea of existence, independent of its correlate,
cannot be apprehended by the human intellect.</p></div>

<p>And Non-Existence and Nothing are <span class="smcap">One</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If all things sprang from non-existence, it might be
urged that non-existence had an objective existence.
But non-existence is nothing, and nothing excludes
the idea of something, making subjective and objective
nothings <span class="smcap">One</span>.</p></div>

<p>Herein is the abiding-place of the Sage.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There where the matter of mortality shares the
tenuity of the formless.</p></div>

<p>"The knowledge of the ancients reached the
highest point,&mdash;the time before anything existed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
This is the highest point. It is exhaustive. There
is no adding to it.</p>

<p>"The second best was that of those who started
from existence. Life was to them a misfortune.
Death was a return home. There was already
separation.</p>

<p>"The next in the scale said that at the beginning
there was nothing. Then life came, to be quickly
followed by death. They made Nothing the head,
Life the trunk, and Death the tail of existence,
claiming as friends whoever knew that existence
and non-existence, and life and death were all <span class="smcap">One</span>.</p>

<p>"These three classes, though different, were of
the same clan; as were Chao Ching who inherited
fame, and Chia who inherited territory.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The fact of inheritance was the same, but not the

<p>"Man's life is as the soot on a kettle.</p>

<p>Yet men speak of the subjective point of view. But
this subjective point of view will not bear the test.
It is a point of knowledge we cannot reach.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Individual standards are fallacious. What is subjective
from one point of view is objective from another.</p></div>

<p>"At the winter sacrifice, the tripe may be separated

<p>He who looks at a house, visits the ancestral hall,
and even the latrines. Thus every point is the
subjective point of view.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Or else he has not seen the house but only a part.
Where then is the subjective point of view of the
house, and by analogy, of the man?</p></div>

<p>"Let us try to formulate this subjective point of
view. It originates with life, and, with knowledge
as its tutor, drifts into the admission of right and
wrong.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the abstract.</p></div>

<p>But one's own standard of right is <em>the</em> standard,
and others have to adapt themselves to it. Men
will die for this. Such people look upon the useful
as appertaining to wisdom, the useless as appertaining
to folly; upon success in life as honourable,
upon failure as dishonourable.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Not knowing the value of the useless, or perceiving
that what is so at one time is not so at another.</p></div>

<p>The subjective point of view is that of the present
generation, who like the cicada and the young dove
see things only from their own standpoint.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See <a href="#Page_1">ch. i</a>.</p></div>

<p>"If a man treads upon a stranger's toe in the
market-place, he apologises on the score of hurry.
If an elder brother does this, he is quit with an
exclamation of sympathy. And if a parent does so,
nothing whatever is done.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Argument</i>:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tao</span> is passionless&mdash;Immorality of the moral&mdash;Obstructions

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Hsü Wu Kuei</span>, introduced by Nü Shang,
went to see Wu Hou of Wei.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A hermit, a minister, and a prince, respectively.</p></div>

<p>The Prince greeted him sympathisingly, and said,
"You are suffering, Sir. You must have endured
great hardships in your mountain life that you
should be willing to leave it and visit me."</p>

<p>"It is I who should sympathise with your
Highness, not your Highness with me," answered
Hsü Wu Kuei. "If your Highness gives free
play to passion and yields to loves and hates, then
the natural conditions of your existence will suffer.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Internally.</p></div>

<p>And if your Highness puts aside passion and
abjures loves and hates, then your senses of sight
and hearing will suffer.</p>

<p>Externally.</p></div>

not your Highness with me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>The Prince was too astonished to reply; and
after a while Hsü Wu Kuei continued, "I will try
to explain to your Highness how I judge of dogs.
The lowest in the scale will eat their fill and then
stop, like a cat. Those of the middle class are as
though staring at the sun. The highest class are
as though they had parted with their own individuality.</p>

<p>"But I do not judge of dogs as well as I judge
of horses. I judge of horses as follows. Their
straightness</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In running.</p></div>

<p>must be that of a line. Their curve must be that of
an arc. Their squareness, that of the square. Their
roundness, that of the compasses.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One commentator applies all this to the shape of
the animals.</p></div>

<p>These are the horses of the State. They are not
equal to the horses of the Empire. The horses of
the Empire are splendid. They move as though
anxious to get along, as though they had lost the
way, as though they had parted with their own
individuality. Thus, they outstrip all competitors,
over the unstirred dust, out of sight!"</p>

<p>The Prince was greatly pleased and smiled. But
when Hsü Wu Kuei went out, Nü Shang asked
him, saying, "What can you have been saying to
his Highness? Whenever I address him, it is either
in a pacific sense, based upon the Canons of <em>Poetry</em>,
<em>History</em>, <em>Rites</em>, and <em>Music</em>; or in a belligerent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>

Plans of Battle</cite>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have transacted with great success innumerable
matters entrusted to me, yet his Highness has
never vouchsafed a smile. What can you have been
saying to make him so pleased as all this?"</p>

<p>"I merely told him," replied Hsü Wu Kuei,
"how I judged of dogs and horses."</p>

<p>"Was that all?" enquired Nü Shang, incredulously.</p>

<p>"Have you not heard," said Hsü Wu Kuei, "of
the outlaw of Yüeh? After several days' absence
from his State, he was glad to meet any one he had
known there. After a month, he was glad to meet
any one he had even seen there. And after a year,
he was glad to meet any one who was in any way
like to his fellow-countrymen. Is not this a case of
absence from one's kind increasing the desire to be
with them?</p>

would rejoice if the footfall of a fellow-creature

to hear the sound of a brother's, of a relative's voice
at his side. Long it is, I ween, since his Highness

latter said, "Living, Sir, up in the hills, and feeding
upon berries or satisfying yourself with leeks, you
have long neglected me. Are you now growing
old? Or do you hanker after flesh-pots and wine?
Or is it that mine is such a well-governed State?"</p>

<p>"I am of lowly birth," replied Hsü Wu Kuei.
"I could not venture to eat and drink your Highness'
meat and wine. I came to sympathise with
your Highness."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" cried the Prince?
"What is there to sympathise about?"</p>

<p>"About your Highness' soul and body," replied
Hsü Wu Kuei.</p>

<p>"Pray explain," said the Prince.</p>

<p>"Nourishment is nourishment," said Hsü Wu
Kuei.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To a peasant as to a prince.</p></div>

<p>"Being high up does not make one high, nor does
being low make one low. Your Highness is the
ruler of a large State, and you oppress the whole
population thereof in order to satisfy your sensualities.
But your soul is not a party to this. The soul
loves harmony and hates disorder. For disorder is
a disease. Therefore I came to sympathise. How
is it that your Highness alone is suffering?"</p>

<p>"I have long desired to see you," answered the
Prince. "I wish to love my people, and by cultivation
of duty towards one's neighbour to put an end
to war. Can this be done?"</p>

<p>"It cannot," replied Hsü Wu Kuei. "Love
for the people is the root of all evil to the people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
Cultivation of duty towards one's neighbour in
order to put an end to war is the origin of all fighting.
If your Highness starts from this basis, the
result can only be disastrous.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Why try to "do" anything?</p></div>

<p>"Everything that is made good, turns out bad.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The artificial is impermanent.</p></div>

<p>And although your Highness should make charity
and duty to one's neighbour, I fear they would be
spurious articles. For the inward intention would
appear in the outward manifestation. The adoption
of a fixed standard</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>I.e.</i> of the personal standard of individuals. See
pp. <a href="#Page_305">305</a>, <a href="#Page_306">306</a>.</p></div>

<p>would lead to complications. And revolutions
within lead to fighting without. Surely your
Highness would not make a bower into a battlefield,
nor a shrine of prayer into a scene of warfare!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This, of course, refers to the mind.</p></div>

<p>"Have nothing within which is obstructive of
virtue. Seek not to vanquish others in cunning, in
plotting, in war. If I slay a whole nation and annex
the territory in order to find nourishment for my
passions and for my soul,&mdash;irrespective of military
skill, wherein does the victory lie?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the
whole world, and lose his own soul?"</p></div>

<p>"If your Highness will only abstain, that will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
enough. Cultivate the sincerity that is within your
breast, so as to be responsive to the conditions of
your environment, and be not aggressive. The
people will thus escape death;</p>

<p>When the Yellow Emperor went to see <span class="smcap">Tao</span> upon
the Chü-tz'ŭ Mountain, Fang Ming was his
charioteer, Ch'ang Yü sat on his right, Chang Jo
and Hsi P'êng were his outriders, and K'un Hun
and Hua Chi brought up the rear.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Commentators tear this passage to tatters.</p></div>

<p>On reaching the wilds of Hsiang-ch'êng,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The limit of the known.</p></div>

<p>these seven Sages lost their way and there was no
one of whom to ask the road. By and by, they fell
in with a boy who was grazing horses, and asked
him, saying, "Do you know the Chü-tz'ŭ Mountain?"</p>

<p>"I do," replied the boy.</p>

<p>"And can you tell us," continued the Sages,
"where <span class="smcap">Tao</span> abides?"</p>

<p>"I can," replied the boy.</p>

<p>"This is a strange lad," cried the Yellow Emperor.
"Not only does he know where the Chü-tz'ŭ
Mountain is, but also where <span class="smcap">Tao</span> abides!
Come tell me, pray, how would you govern the
empire?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should govern the empire," said the boy,
"just the same as I look after my horses. What
else should I do?</p>

<p>"When I was a little boy and used to live within
the points of the compass,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In Vanity Fair.</p></div>

<p>my eyes got dim of sight. An old man advised me
to mount the chariot of the sun</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>I.e.</i> of Intelligence.</p></div>

<p>and visit the wilds of Hsiang-ch'êng. My sight is
now much better, and I continue to dwell without
the points of the compass. I should govern the
empire in just the same way. What else should
I do?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said the Yellow Emperor, "government
is not your trade. Still I should be glad to
hear what you would do."</p>

<p>The boy declined to answer, but on being again
urged, cried out, "What difference is there between
governing the empire and looking after horses?
See that no harm comes to the horses, that is all!"</p>

<p>Thereupon the Emperor prostrated himself before
the boy; and addressing him as Divine Teacher,
took his leave.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Divine Teacher means "inspired by God." The
term used is that employed in modern times for the
head or Pope of debased Taoism, often wrongly
rendered as the "Master of Heaven."</p></div>

<p>If schemers have nothing to give them anxiety,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
they are not happy. If dialecticians have not their
premisses and conclusion, they are not happy. If
critics have none on whom to vent their spleen, they
are not happy. Such men are the slaves of objective
existences.</p>

<p>Those who attract the sympathies of the world,
start new dynasties. Those who win the people's
hearts, take high official rank. Those who are strong
undertake difficulties. Those who are brave encounter
dangers. Men of arms delight in war.
Men of peace think of nothing but reputation. Men
of law strive to improve the administration. Professors
of ceremony and music cultivate deportment.
Moralists devote themselves to the obligations
between man and man.</p>

<p>Take away agriculture from the husbandman,
and his classification is gone. Take away trade
from the merchant, and his classification is gone.
Daily work is the stimulus of the labourer. The
skill of the artisan is his pride. If money cannot
be made, the avaricious man is sad. If his power
meets with a check, the boaster will repine. Ambitious
men love change.</p>

<p>Thus, men are always doing something; inaction
is to them impossible. They observe in this the
same regularity as the seasons, ever without change.
They hurry to destruction, dissipating in all directions
their vital forces, alas! never to return.</p>

make ice in summer.'</p>

<p>"'You merely avail yourself of latent heat and

<p>"Thereupon he tuned two lutes, and placed one

And when he struck the <em>Kung</em> note on one, the
<em>Kung</em> note on the other sounded; when he struck
the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">chio</i> note on one, the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">chio</i> note on the other
sounded. This because they were both tuned to
the same pitch.</p>

<p>"But if he changed the interval of one string, so
that it no longer kept its place in the octave, and
then struck it, the result was that all the twenty-five
strings jangled together. There was sound as
before, but the influence of the key-note was gone. Is
this your case?"</p>

<p>"The Confucianists, the Mihists, and the followers
of Yang and Ping," replied Hui Tzŭ, "are just
now engaged in discussing this matter with me.
They try to overwhelm me with argument or howl
me down with noise. Yet they have not proved me
wrong. Why then should you?"</p>

<p>"A man of the Ch'i State," replied Chuang Tzŭ,
"sent away his son into the Sung State, to be a
door-keeper, with maimed body.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Doorkeepers in ancient times were, for obvious

<p>"If a man of Ch'u, who was sent away to be a
door-keeper, began, in the middle of the night, when
no one was about, to fight with the boatman, I

<p>Chuang Tzŭ was once attending a funeral, when
he passed by the grave of Hui Tzŭ. Turning to
his attendants, he said, "A man of Ying</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>who had his nose covered with a hard scab, no
thicker than a fly's wing, sent for a stone-mason to
chip it off. The stone-mason plied his adze with
great dexterity while the patient sat still and let
him chip. When the scab was all off, the nose was
found to be uninjured, the man of Ying never
having moved a muscle.</p>

<p>"When Yüan, prince of Sung, heard of this, he
summoned the stone-mason and said, 'Try to do
the same for me.'</p>

<p>"'I used to be able to do it Sire,' replied the
stone-mason, 'but my material has long since
perished.'</p>

<p>"And I too, ever since he perished, have been
without my material, having no one with whom I

<p>"You are ill, venerable Sir," said the Duke,
"really ill. You had better say to whom, in the
event of your getting worse, I am to entrust the
administration of the State."</p>

<p>"Whom does your Highness wish to choose?"
enquired Kuan Chung.</p>

<p>"Will Pao Yü do?" asked the Duke.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Kuan Chung and Pao Yü are the "Damon and

incorruptible, and good. With those who are not
like himself, he will not associate. And if he has
once heard of a man's wrong-doing, he never
forgets it. If you employ him in the administration
of the empire, he will get to loggerheads with his
prince and to sixes and sevens with the people. It
would not be long before he and your Highness fell

<p>"Whom then can we have?" asked the Duke.</p>

<p>"There is no alternative," replied Kuan Chung;
"it must be Hsi P'êng. He is a man who forgets
the authority of those above him, and makes those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>

<p>The prince of Wu took a boat and went to the
Monkey Mountain, which he ascended. When the
monkeys saw him, they fled in terror and hid themselves
in the thicket. One of them, however, disported
himself carelessly, as though showing off its
skill before the prince. The prince took a shot at it;
but the monkey, with great rapidity, seized the
flying arrow with its hand. Then the prince bade
his guards try, the result being that the monkey
was killed.</p>

<p>"Love and profit are born of charity and duty
to one's neighbour. Those who ignore charity and
duty to one's neighbour are few; those who make
capital out of them are many.</p>

<p>"For the operation of these virtues is not disinterested.
It is like lending gear to a sportsman.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>With a view to share the game.</p></div>

<p>Wherefore, for one man to dogmatise for the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
of the whole empire, is like splitting a thing at a
single blow.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Without reference to method or the requirements of
the case in point.</p></div>

<p>"Yao knows that good men benefit the empire.
But he does not know that they injure it. Only
those on a higher level than good men know this.</p>

<p>"There are nincompoops; there are parasites;
there are enthusiasts.</p>

<p>"A man who learns from a single teacher, and
then goes off exultant, satisfied with his acquirements
though ignorant that there was a time when
nothing existed,&mdash;such a one is a nincompoop.</p>

<p>"Parasites are like the lice on a pig's back. They
choose bald patches, which are to them palaces and
parks. The parts between the toes, the joints, the
dugs, and the buttocks, are to them so many comfortable
and convenient resting-places. They know
not that one day the butcher will tuck up his
sleeves and spread straw and apply fire, and that
they will perish in the singeing of the pig. As they
sow, so do they reap. This is to be a parasite.</p>

<p>"Of enthusiasts, Shun is an example. Mutton
does not care for ants; it is the ants which care for
the mutton. Mutton has a frowsy smell; and
there is a frowsiness about Shun which attracts
the people. Therefore it was that after three
changes of residence, when he came to the Têng
district, he had some hundred thousand families
with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then Yao, hearing of his goodness, appointed
him to a barren region, trusting, as he said, that
Shun's arrival would enrich it. When Shun took
up this appointment, he was already old, and his
intellect was failing; yet he would not cease work
and retire from office. He was, in fact, an enthusiast.</p>

<p>"So it is that the spiritual man dislikes a crowd.
For where there is a crowd there is diversity, and
where there is diversity advantage does not accrue.
He is therefore neither very intimate, nor very
distant. He clings to virtue and nourishes a spirit
of harmony, in order to be in accord with his
fellow-men. This is to be a divine man.</p>

<p>"Leave wisdom to ants. Strive for what fishes
desire.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To be left alone in the water.</p></div>

<p>"Leave attractiveness to mutton. Use your eyes to
contemplate, your ears to listen to, your mind to
consider, their own internal workings. For him
who can do these things, his level will be that of a
line, his modifications in due and proper season.</p>

<p>"Therefore, the divine man trusts to the natural
development of events. He does not strive to
introduce the artificial into the domain of the
natural. Accordingly, life is a gain and death a
loss, or death is a gain and life a loss.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>According to circumstances.</p></div>

<p>"For instance, drugs. They are characteristically
poisonous. Such are <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Chieh-Kêng</i>, <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Chi-Yung</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
<i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Shih-Ling</i>. Circumstances, however, make of each
a sovereign remedy. The list is inexhaustible.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Chieh-Kêng is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Platycodon grandiflorum</i>. It is
used by Chinese doctors as a tonic, astringent, and
vermifuge.</p></div>

<p>"When Kou Chien encamped with three thousand
armed warriors at Kuei-ch'i,</p>

he could not foresee the evil that was to come upon
himself. Wherefore it has been said, 'An owl's
eyes are adapted to their use. A crane's leg is of

<p>"Thus it has been said, 'The wind blows and
the river suffers. The sun shines and the river
suffers.' But though wind and sun be both brought
into relation with the river, it does not really suffer
therefrom. Fed from its source, it still continues
to flow on.</p>

<p>"The foot treads the ground in walking; nevertheless
it is the ground not trodden on which makes

of God.</p>

<p>"Knowledge of the great <span class="smcap">One</span>, of the great

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">When</span> Tsê Yang visited the Ch'u State, I
Chieh</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An official of Ch'u.</p></div>

<p>spoke of him to the prince; but the latter refused
an audience.</p>

<p>Upon I Chieh's return, Tsê Yang went to see
Wang Kuo,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A local Sage.</p></div>

<p>and asked him to obtain an interview with the
prince.</p>

<p>"I am not so fitted for that," replied Wang Kuo,
"as Kung Yüeh Hsiu."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A hermit.</p></div>

<p>"What sort of a man is he?" enquired Tsê
Yang.</p>

<p>"In winter," said Wang Kuo, "he catches turtles
on the river. In summer, he reposes in some
mountain copse. If any passers-by ask of him, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
tells them, "This is my home." Where I Chieh
could not succeed, still less should I. I am not
equal even to him.</p>

<p>"He is a man without virtue, but possessed of
knowledge. Were it not for an air of arrogance, he
would be very popular with his superiors. But help
without virtue is a hindrance. Shivering people
borrowing clothes in the coming spring! Hot
people thinking of last winter's icy blast!</p>

<p>"The prince of Ch'u is dignified and severe. In
punishing, he is merciless as a tiger. Only a very
practised or a very perfect man could influence him.</p>

<p>"The true Sage, when in obscurity, causes those
around him to forget their poverty. When in
power, he causes princes to forget ranks and emoluments,
and to become as though of low estate. He
rejoices exceedingly in all creation. He exults to
see <span class="smcap">Tao</span> diffused among his fellow-men, while
suffering no loss himself.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Tao</span> is a constant quantity. It can be shared, but
cannot be divided.</p></div>

<p>"Thus, although silent, he can instil peace; and
by his mere presence cause men to be to each other
as father and son. From his very return to passivity
comes this active influence for good. So
widely does he differ in heart from ordinary men.
Wherefore I said, 'Wait for Kung Yüeh Hsiu.'</p>

<p>"The true Sage is free from all embarrassments.
All things are to him as <span class="smcap">One</span>. Yet he knows not
that this is so. It is simply nature. In the midst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
of action he remains the same. He makes God his
guide, and men make him theirs. He grieves that
wisdom carries one but a short distance, and at
times comes altogether to a deadlock.</p>

<p>"To a beauty, mankind is the mirror in which she
sees herself. If no one tells her she is beautiful,
she does not know that she is so. But whether she
knows it or whether she does not know it, whether
she hears it or whether she does not hear it, her joy
will never cease, neither will mankind ever cease to
take pleasure therein. It is nature.</p>

<p>"The love of a Sage for his fellows likewise finds
expression among mankind. Were he not told so,
he would not know that he loved his fellows. But
whether he knows it or whether he does not know
it, whether he hears it or whether he does not hear
it, his love for his fellows is without end, and mankind
cease not to repose therein.</p>

<p>"The old country, the old home, gladden a wanderer's
eyes. Nay, though nine-tenths of it be a
howling wilderness, still his eye will be glad. How
much more to see sight and hear hearing, from a
lofty dais suspended in their very midst!"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The joy of the wanderer is as that of the mind
returning to a consciousness only of itself.</p></div>

<p>Jen Hsiang Shih reached the centre and attained.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The centre at which all Infinities converge. See
p. <a href="#Page_18">18</a>. This individual was a legendary ruler of
old.</p></div>

<p>He recognised no beginning, no end, no quantity,
no time. Daily modified together with his environ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>ment,
as part of <span class="smcap">One</span> he knew no modification.
Why not rest in this?</p>

<p>To strive to follow God and not to succeed is to
display an activity fatal to itself. How can success
ever be thus achieved?</p>

<p>The true Sage ignores God. He ignores man. He
ignores a beginning. He ignores matter. He moves
in harmony with his generation and suffers not.
He takes things as they come and is not overwhelmed.
How are we to become like him?</p>

<p>T'ang appointed his Equerry, Mên Yin Têng
Hêng, to be his tutor, listening to his counsels but
not being restricted by them. He got <span class="smcap">Tao</span> for himself
and a reputation for his tutor. But the reputation
was a violation of principle, and landed him in
the domain of alternatives.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Instead of <span class="smcap">One</span>. No ingenuity of commentator has
here succeeded in making sense.</p></div>

<p>Prince Hui of Wei had made a treaty with
prince Wei of Ch'i, which the latter broke.</p>

<p>Thereupon prince Hui was wroth, and was about
to send a man to assassinate him. But the Captain-General
heard of this, and cried out in shame,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
"Sire, you are ruler over a mighty State, yet you
would seek the vengeance of a common man.
Give me two hundred thousand warriors, and I
will do the work for you. I will take his people
prisoners, and carry off their oxen and horses. I
will make the heat of the prince's mind break out
on his back. Then I will seize his country, and
he will flee. Then you can wring his neck as you
please."</p>

<p>When Chi Tzŭ heard this, he cried out in shame
and said, "If you are building a ten-perch wall,
and when the wall is near completion, destroy it,
you inflict great hardship on the workmen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Alluding to the <em>corvée</em> system of public works. The
speaker was an official of Wei.</p></div>

<p>Now for seven years the troops have not been

foundation work. Listen not to the Captain-General.
He is a mischievous fellow."</p>

<p>When Hua Tzŭ</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Also an official of Wei.</p></div>

<p>heard this, he was very indignant and said, "He
who argued in favour of punishing the Ch'i State
was a mischievous fellow. And he who argued
against punishing the Ch'i State was a mischievous
fellow. And he who says that either of the above
is a mischievous fellow, is a mischievous fellow
himself."</p>

<p>"Where then shall I find what to do?" enquired
the prince.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>"In <span class="smcap">Tao</span> alone," said Hua Tzŭ.</p>

<p>When Hui Tzŭ heard this, he introduced Tai
Chin Jen to the prince.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A Sage of the Liang State. For Hui Tzŭ, see p. <a href="#Page_8">8</a>.</p></div>

<p>"There is a creature called a snail," said Tai
Chin Jen. "Does your Highness know what I
mean?"</p>

<p>"I do," replied the prince.</p>

<p>"There is a kingdom on its left horn," continued
Tai Chin Jen, "ruled over by <em>Aggression</em>, and
another on its right horn, ruled over by <em>Violence</em>.
These two rulers are constantly fighting for territory.
In such cases, corpses lie about by thousands,
and one party will pursue the other for fifteen days
before returning."</p>

<p>"Whew!" cried the prince. "Surely you are
joking."</p>

<p>"Sire," replied Tai Chin Jen, "I beg you to
regard it as fact. Does your Highness recognise
any limit to space?"</p>

<p>"None," said the prince, "It is boundless."</p>

<p>"When, therefore," continued Tai Chin Jen,
"the mind descends from the contemplation of
boundless space to the contemplation of a kingdom
with fixed boundaries, that kingdom must
seem to be of dimensions infinitesimally small?"</p>

<p>"Of course," replied the prince.</p>

<p>"Well then," said Tai Chin Jen, "in a kingdom
with fixed boundaries</p>

<div class="blockquot">

prince. In what does that prince differ from
Violence?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In his pettiness.</p></div>

<p>"There is no difference," said the prince.</p>

<p>Thereupon Tai Chin Jen took his leave, and the
prince remained in a state of mental perturbation,
as though he had lost something.</p>

<p>When Tai Chin Jen had gone, Hui Tzŭ presented
himself, and the prince said, "Our friend is
truly a great man. Sages are not his equal."</p>

<p>"If you blow through a tube," replied Hui Tzŭ,
"the result will be a note. If you blow through
the hole in a sword-hilt, the result will be simply

mankind; yet compared with Tai Chin Jen they

<p>Poh Chü was studying under Lao Tzŭ. "Let us
go," said he, "and wander over the world."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One commentator says Poh Chü was a "criminal,"
probably from his sympathetic remarks in the context.</p></div>

<p>"No," replied Lao Tzŭ, "the world is just as
you see it here."</p>

<p>But as he again urged it, Lao Tzŭ said, "Where
would you go to begin with?"</p>

<p>"I would begin," answered Poh Chü, "by going
to the Ch'i State. There I would view the dead
bodies of their malefactors. I would push them to
make them rise. I would take off my robes and
cover them. I would cry to God and bemoan their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
lot, as follows:&mdash;'O sirs, O sirs, there was trouble

perhaps murderers?' ... Honour and disgrace

<p>"The rulers of old set off all success to the
credit of their people, attributing all failure to
themselves. All that was right went to the credit
of their people, all that was wrong they attributed
to themselves. Therefore, if any matter fell short
of achievement, they turned and blamed themselves.</p>

<p>"Not so the rulers of to-day. They conceal a
thing and blame those who cannot see it. They
impose dangerous tasks and punish those who
dare not undertake them. They inflict heavy burdens
and chastise those who cannot bear them.
They ordain long marches and slay those who
cannot make them.</p>

If their strength is insufficient, they will have recourse

spent his time in hunting, and did not cultivate the
goodwill of the other feudal princes. How was it
he came to be called <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Ling</i>?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The name <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Ling</i> means "knowing," which may be
taken in two senses.</p></div>

<p>"For those very reasons," replied Ta T'ao.</p>

<p>"The Duke," said Poh Ch'ang Ch'ien, "had
three wives. He was having a bath together with
them when Shih Ch'in, summoned by his Highness,
entered the apartment. Thereupon the Duke
covered himself and the ladies. So outrageously
did he behave on the one hand, and yet so respectful
was he towards a virtuous man. Hence he was
called <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Ling</i>."</p>

<p>"When the Duke died," said Hsi Wei, "divination
showed that it would be inauspicious to bury
him in the old family burying-ground, but auspicious
to bury him at Sha-ch'iu. And upon digging
a grave there, several fathoms deep, a stone coffin
was found, which, being cleaned, yielded the following
inscription:&mdash;<em>Posterity cannot be trusted.
Duke Ling will seize this for his tomb.</em></p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, Duke Ling had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
named Ling long before. What should these two
persons know about it?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As evidenced by the inscription, the Duke had been
so named long before, in the Book of Fate.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Shao Chih asked T'ai Kung Tiao, saying,
"What is meant by society?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The first name signifies <em>Small Knowledge</em>. Of the
second personage there is no record.</p></div>

<p>"Society," replied T'ai Kung Tiao, "is an agreement
of a certain number of families and individuals
to abide by certain customs. Discordant
elements unite to form a harmonious whole. Take
away this unity and each has a separate individuality.</p>

<p>"Point at any one of the many parts of a horse,
and that is not a horse, although there is the horse
before you. It is the combination of all which
makes the horse.</p>

<p>"Similarly, a mountain is high because of its
individual particles. A river is large because of
its individual drops. And he is a just man who
regards all parts from the point of view of the
whole.</p>

<p>"Thus, in regard to the views of others, he holds
his own opinion, but not obstinately. In regard to
his own views, while conscious of their truth, he
does not despise the opinions of others.</p>

<p>"The four seasons have different characteristics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
but God shows no preference for either, and therefore
we have the year complete.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>With results which could not be otherwise achieved.</p></div>

<p>The functions of the various classes of officials
differ; but the sovereign shows no partiality, and
therefore the empire is governed. There are the
civil and the military; but the truly great man
shows no preference for either, and therefore their
efficacy is complete. All things are under the
operation of varying laws; but <span class="smcap">Tao</span> shows no
partiality and therefore it cannot be identified.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As the given part of anything.</p></div>

<p>Not being able to be identified, it consequently
does nothing. And by doing nothing all things
can be done.</p>

<p>"Seasons have their beginnings and their ends.
Generations change and change. Good and evil
fortune alternate, bringing sorrow here, happiness
there.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Nunc mihi, nunc alio, benigna.</p></div>

<p>He who obstinately views things from his own
standpoint only, may be right in one case and
wrong in another. Just as in a great jungle all kinds
of shrubs are found together; or as on a mountain
you see trees and stones indiscriminately mixed,&mdash;so
is what we call society."</p>

<p>"Would it not do then," asked Shao Chih, "if
we were to call this <span class="smcap">Tao</span>?"</p>

<p>"It would not," replied T'ai Kung Tiao. "All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
creation is made up of more than ten thousand
things. We speak of creation as the <em>Ten Thousand
Things</em> merely because it is a convenient term by
which to express a large number. In point of outward
shape the universe is vast. In point of influence
the Positive and Negative principles are
mighty. Yet <span class="smcap">Tao</span> folds them all in its embrace.
For convenience' sake the bond of society is called
great. But how can that which is thus conditioned</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By having a name.</p></div>

<p>be compared with <span class="smcap">Tao</span>? There is as wide a
difference between them as there is between a horse
and a dog."</p>

<p>"Whence then," enquired Shao Chih, "comes
the vitality of all things between the four points of
the compass, between heaven above and earth
beneath?"</p>

<p>"The Positive and Negative principles," answered
T'ai Kung Tiao, "influence, act upon, and regulate
each other. The four seasons alternate with, give
birth to, and destroy one another. Hence, loves and
hates, and courses rejected and courses adopted.
Hence too, the intercourse of the sexes.</p>

<p>"States of peril and safety alternate. Good and
evil fortune give birth to one another. Slowness
and speed are mutually exclusive. Collection and
dispersion are correlates. The actuality of these
may be noted.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is the name and the embodiment.</p></div>

<p>The essence of each can be verified. There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
regular movement forward, modified by deflection
into a curve. Exhaustion leads to renewal. The
end introduces a new beginning. This is the law
of material existences. The force of language, the
reach of knowledge, cannot pass beyond the bounds
of such material existences. The disciple of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>
refrains from prying into the states after or before.
Human speculation stops short of this."</p>

<p>"Chi Chên," said Shao Chih, "taught <em>Chance</em>;
Chieh Tzŭ taught <em>Predestination</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Two Sages." <i>Comm.</i></p></div>

<p>In the speculations of these two schools, on which
side did right lie?"</p>

<p>"The cock crows," replied T'ai Kung Tiao,
"and the dog barks. So much we know. But the
wisest of us could not say why one crows and the
other barks, nor guess why they crow or bark
at all.</p>

<p>"Let me explain. The infinitely small is inappreciable;
the infinitely great is immeasurable.
Chance and Predestination must refer to the conditioned.
Consequently, both are wrong.</p>

<p>"Predestination involves a real existence.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of a God.</p></div>

<p>Chance implies an absolute absence of any principle.
To have a name and the embodiment thereof,&mdash;this
is to have a material existence. To have no
name and no embodiment,&mdash;of this one can speak
and think; but the more one speaks the farther off
one gets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>"The unborn creature cannot be kept from life.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>So powerful is its "will to live."</p></div>

<p>The dead cannot be tracked. From birth to death
is but a span; yet the secret cannot be known.
Chance and Predestination are but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">à priori</i>
solutions.</p>

<p>"When I seek for a beginning, I find only time
infinite. When I look forward to an end, I see
only time infinite. Infinity of time past and to
come implies no beginning and is in accordance
with the laws of material existences. Predestination
and Chance give us a beginning, but one which is
compatible only with the existence of matter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And not with the time before matter was.</p></div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Tao</span> cannot be existent. If it were existent, it
could not be non-existent. The very name of
<span class="smcap">Tao</span> is only adopted for convenience' sake. Predestination
and Chance are limited to material
existences. How can they bear upon the infinite?</p>

<p>"Were language adequate, it would take but a
day to fully set forth <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. Not being adequate,
it takes that time to explain material existences.
<span class="smcap">Tao</span> is something beyond material existences. It
cannot be conveyed either by words or by silence.
In that state which is neither speech nor silence, its
transcendental nature may be apprehended."</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Contingencies</span> are uncertain. Hence the

death of Wu Lai, the flights of Chieh and Chou.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See pp. <a href="#Page_40">40</a>, <a href="#Page_72">72</a>. Wu Lai was an intriguing

<p>No parent but would have filial sons; yet filial

Hsiao Chi sorrowed, and Tsêng Shên grieved.</p>

<p>The first, prince of the House of Yin, was turned

<p>Wood rubbed with wood produces fire. Metal
exposed to fire will liquefy. If the Positive and
Negative principles operate inharmoniously, heaven
and earth are greatly disturbed. Thunder crashes,
and with rain comes lightning, scorching up the
tall locust-trees. One fears lest sky and land should
collapse and leave no escape. Unable to lie <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">perdu</i>,
the heart feels as though suspended between heaven
and earth.</p>

<p>So in the struggle between peace and unrest, the
friction between good and evil, much fire is evolved
which consumes the inner harmony of man. But
the mind is unable to resist fire. It is destroyed,
and with it <span class="smcap">Tao</span> comes to an end.</p>

<p>Chuang Tzŭ's family being poor, he went to
borrow some corn from the prince of Chien-ho.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the prince. "I am just about
collecting the revenue of my fief, and will then
lend you three hundred ounces of silver. Will
that do?"</p>

<p>At this Chuang Tzŭ flushed with anger and
said, "Yesterday, as I was coming along, I heard
a voice calling me. I looked round, and in the cart-rut
I saw a stickleback.</p>

<p>"'And what do you want, stickleback?' said I.</p>

from the west river. Will that do?'</p>

<p>"At this the stickleback flushed with anger and
said, 'I am out of my element. I have nowhere to

<p>A young noble of the Jen State. <i>Comm.</i></p></div>

<p>got a huge hook on a big line, which he baited with
fifty oxen. He squatted down at Kuei-chi, and cast
into the eastern ocean. Every day he fished, but for
a whole year he caught nothing. Then came a great
fish which swallowed the bait, and dragging the
huge hook dived down below. This way and that
way it plunged about, erecting the dorsal fin. The
white waves rolled mountain high. The great deep
was shaken up. The noise was like that of so
many devils, terrifying people for many miles
around.</p>

<p>But when Jên Kung Tzŭ had secured his fish, he
cut it up and salted it. And from Chih-ho eastwards,
and from Ts'ang-wu northwards, there was
none but ate his fill of that fish. Even among
succeeding generations, <em>gobemouches</em> of the day

<p>To take a rod and line, and go to a pool, and

big fish. And by means of a little show of
ability to secure some small billet is a very different
thing from really pushing one's way to the front.

On his return, he said, "There is a man over there

<p>Prince Yüan of Sung dreamed one night that a
man with dishevelled hair peeped through a side
door and said, "I have come from the waters of
Tsai-lu. I am a marine messenger attached to the
staff of the River God. A fisherman, named Yü
Ch'ieh, has caught me."</p>

<p>When the prince awaked, he referred his dream
to the soothsayers, who said, "This is a divine
tortoise."</p>

<p>"Is there any fisherman," asked the prince,
"whose name is Yü Ch'ieh?"</p>

<p>Being told there was, the prince gave orders for
his appearance at court; and the next day Yü
Ch'ieh had an audience.</p>

<p>"Fisherman," said the prince, "what have you
caught?"</p>

<p>"I have netted a white tortoise," replied the
fisherman, "five feet in semi-circumference."</p>

<p>"Bring your tortoise," said the prince. But
when it came, the prince could not make up his
mind whether to kill it or keep it alive. Thus in
doubt, he had recourse to divination, and received
the following response:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Slay the tortoise for purposes of divination and
good fortune will result.</em></p>

<p>So the tortoise was despatched. After which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
out of seventy-two omens taken, not a single one
proved false.</p>

<p>"A divine tortoise," said Confucius, "can appear
to prince Yüan in a dream, yet it cannot escape
the net of Yü Ch'ieh. Its wisdom can yield
seventy-two faultless omens, yet it cannot escape
the misery of being cut to pieces. Truly wisdom
has its limits; spirituality, that which it cannot
reach.</p>

<p>"In spite of the highest wisdom, there are countless
snares to be avoided; If a fish has not to fear

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Language.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Argument</i>:&mdash;Speech, natural and artificial&mdash;Natural speech in harmony
with the divine&mdash;Destiny&mdash;The ultimate cause&mdash;Purification of the
soul&mdash;Illustrations.</p></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Of</span> language put into other people's mouths, nine
tenths will succeed. Of language based upon
weighty authority, seven tenths. But language
which flows constantly over, as from a full goblet,
is in accord with God.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The natural overflowings of the heart.</p></div>

<p>When language is put into other people's mouths,
outside support is sought. Just as a father does
not negotiate his son's marriage; for any praise he
could bestow would not have the same value as
praise by an outsider. Thus, the fault is not mine,
but that of others.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Who will not believe the original speaker.</p></div>

<p>To that which agrees with our own opinions we
assent; from that which does not we dissent. We
regard that which agrees with our own opinion as
right. We regard that which differs from our
opinion as wrong. Language based on weighty
authority is used to bar further argument. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
authorities are our superiors, our elders in years.
But if they lack the requisite knowledge and experience,
being our superiors only in the sense of
age, then they are not our superiors. And if men
are not the superiors of their fellows, no one troubles
about them. And those about whom no one troubles
are merely stale.</p>

<p>Language which flows constantly over, as from
a full goblet, is in accord with God.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Embracing both positive and negative in <span class="smcap">One</span>.</p></div>

<p>Because it spreads out on all sides, it endures for
all time. Without language, contraries are identical.
The identity is not identical with its expression:
the expression is not identical with its
identity. Therefore it has been said, Language
not expressed in language is not language. Constantly
spoken, it is as though not spoken. Constantly
unspoken, it is not as though not spoken.</p>

<p>From the subjective point of view, there are
possibilities and impossibilities, there are suitabilities
and unsuitabilities. This results from the
natural affinity of things for what they are and
their natural antagonism to what they are not.
For all things have their own particular constitutions
and potentialities. Nothing can exist without
these.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See p. <a href="#Page_19">19</a>.</p></div>

<p>But for language that constantly flows over, as
from a full goblet, and is in accord with God, how
should the permanent be attained?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>All things spring from germs. Under many
diverse forms these things are ever being reproduced.
Round and round, like a wheel, no part of
which is more the starting-point than any other.
This is called the equilibrium of God. And he
who holds the scales is God.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Alluding to the Identity-philosophy, which means,
in the words of Emerson, "that nature iterates her
means perpetually on successive planes.... The
whole art of the plant is still to repeat leaf on leaf
without end."</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Chuang Tzŭ said to Hui Tzŭ, "When Confucius
reached his sixtieth year he changed his opinions.
What he had previously regarded as right, he ultimately
came to regard as wrong. But who shall
say whether the right of to-day may not be as
wrong as the wrong of the previous fifty-nine
years?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See p. <a href="#Page_345">345</a>.</p></div>

<p>"He was a persevering worker," replied Hui
Tzŭ, "and his wisdom increased day by day."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His conversion was no spasmodic act.</p></div>

<p>"Confucius," replied Chuang Tzŭ, "discarded
both perseverance and wisdom, but did not attempt
to formulate the doctrine in words. He said, 'Man
has received his talents from God, together with a
soul to give them life. He should speak in accordance
with established laws. His words should be
in harmony with fixed order. Personal advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
and duty to one's neighbour lie open before us.
Likes and dislikes, rights and wrongs, are but as
men choose to call them. But to bring submission
into men's hearts, so that they shall not be stiff-necked,
and thus fix firmly the foundations of the
empire,&mdash;to that, alas! I have not attained.'"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"From the above," says Lin Hsi Chung, "we may
see that Hui Tzŭ, though skilled in winning debates
was unskilled in winning hearts."</p></div>

<p>Tsêng Tzŭ held office twice. His emotions varied
in each case.</p>

<p>"As long as my parents were alive," said he, "I
was happy on a small salary. When I had a large
salary, but my parents were no more, I was sad."</p>

<p>A disciple said to Confucius, "Can we call Tsêng
Tzŭ a man without cares to trouble him?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Money being no object to him.</p></div>

<p>"He had cares to trouble him," replied Confucius.
"Can a man who has no cares to trouble him feel
grief? His small salary and his large salary were
to him like a heron or a mosquito flying past."</p>

<p>Yen Ch'êng Tzŭ Yu said to Tung Kuo Tzŭ Chi,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See p. <a href="#Page_324">324</a>.</p></div>

<p>"One year after receiving your instructions I became
naturally simple. After two years, I could
adapt myself as required. After three years, I un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>derstood.
After four years, my intelligence developed.
After five years, it was complete. After six
years, the spirit entered into me. After seven, I
knew God. After eight, life and death existed for
me no more. After nine, perfection.</p>

<p>"Life has its distinctions; but in death we are
all made equal. That death should have an origin,
but that life should have no origin,&mdash;can this be
so? What determines its presence in one place,
its absence in another?</p>

<p>"Heaven has its fixed order.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Visible to all.</p></div>

<p>Earth has yielded up its secrets to man. But
where to seek whence am I?</p>

<p>"Not knowing the hereafter, how can we deny
the operation of Destiny? Not knowing what preceded
birth, how can we assert the operation of
Destiny? When things turn out as they ought,
who shall say that the agency is not supernatural?
When things turn out otherwise, who shall say that
it is?"</p>

<p>The various Penumbræ said to the Umbra,
"Before you were looking down, now you are looking
up. Before you had your hair tied up, now
it is all loosed. Before you were sitting, now you
have got up. Before you were moving, now you
are stopping still. How is this?"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," replied the Umbra, "the question
is hardly worth asking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>I do these things, but I do not know why. I am
like the scaly back of the cicada, the shell of the
locust,&mdash;apparently independent, but not really so.
By firelight or in daylight I am seen: in darkness
or by night I am gone. And if I am dependent on
these, how much more are they dependent on something
else? When they come, I come with them.
When they go, I go with them. When they live,
I live with them. But who it is that gives the life,
how shall we seek to know?"</p>

<p>went southwards to P'ei, and when Lao Tzŭ was
travelling westwards to Ch'in, hastened to receive
him outside the city. Arriving at the bridge, he
met Lao Tzŭ; and the latter standing in the
middle of the road, looked up to heaven and said
with a sigh, "At first, I thought you could be
taught. I think so no more."</p>

<p>Yang Tzŭ Chü made no reply, but when they
reached the inn, handed Lao Tzŭ water for washing
and rinsing, and a towel and comb. He then removed
his own boots outside the door, and crawling
on his knees into the Master's presence, said, "I
have been wishing to ask for instruction, Sir, but
as you were travelling and not at leisure, I did not
venture. You are now, Sir, at leisure. May I
enquire the reason of what you said?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have an overbearing look," said Lao Tzŭ.
"Who would live with such a man? He who is
truly pure behaves as though he were sullied. He
who has virtue in abundance behaves as though it
were not enough."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These last two sentences occur in the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>,
ch. xli, and also in the works of Lieh Tzŭ as part of
that author's own text. See <cite>The Remains of Lao
Tzŭ</cite>, p. 29.</p></div>

<p>Yang Tzŭ Chü changed countenance at this, and
replied, "I hear and obey."</p>

<p>Now when Yang Tzü Chü first went to the inn,
the visitors there had come out to receive him.
Mine host had arranged his mat, while the landlady
held towel and comb. The visitors had given
him up the best seats, and those who were cooking
had left the stove free for him. But when he went
back,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>After his interview with Lao Tzŭ.</p></div>

<p>the other visitors struggled to get the best seats for
themselves.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>So changed was he in spirit.</p>

<p>Lin Hsi Chung considers that this chapter should
immediately precede what is now <a href="#Page_423">ch. xxxii</a>, from

the four following chapters, all admittedly spurious.</p></div>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">On Declining Power.</span></p>

<p class="ph4">[Spurious.]</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Yao</span> offered to resign the empire to Hsü Yu,
but the latter declined.</p>

<p>He then offered it to Tzŭ Chou Chih Fu, who
said, "There is no objection to making me emperor.
But just now I am suffering from a troublesome
disease, and am engaged in trying to cure it.
I have no leisure to look after the empire."</p>

<p>Now the empire is of paramount importance.
Yet here was a man who would not allow it to
injure his chance of life. How much less then
would he let other things do so? Yet it is only he
who would do nothing in the way of government
who is fit to be trusted with the empire.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Those personages who have not been previously
mentioned may be taken to be allegorical.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Shun offered to resign the empire to Tzŭ Chou
Chih Poh. The latter said, "Just now I am
suffering from a troublesome disease, and am
engaged in trying to cure it. I have no leisure to
look after the empire."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the empire is a great trust; but not to
sacrifice one's life for it is precisely where the man
of <span class="smcap">Tao</span> differs from the man of the world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Shun offered to resign the empire to Shan
Chüan. Shan Chüan said, "I am a unit in the
sum of the universe. In winter I wear fur clothes.
In summer I wear grass-cloth. In spring I plough
and sow, toiling with my body. In autumn I gather
in the harvest, and devote myself to rest and enjoyment.
At dawn I go to work; at sunset I leave
off. Contented with my lot I pass through life with
a light heart. Why then should I trouble myself
with the empire? Ah, Sir, you do not know me."</p>

<p>So he declined, and subsequently hid himself
among the mountains, nobody knew where.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Shun offered the empire to a friend, a labourer
of Shih Hu.</p>

<p>"Sire," said the latter, "you exert yourself too
much. The chief thing is to husband one's strength;"&mdash;meaning
that in point of real virtue Shun had not
attained.</p>

<p>Then, husband and wife, bearing away their
household gods and taking their children with
them, went off to the sea and never came back.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When T'ai Wang Shan Fu was occupying Pin,
he was attacked by savages. He offered them skins
and silk, but they declined these. He offered them
dogs and horses, but they declined these also.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
He then offered them pearls and jade, but these
too they declined. What they wanted was the
territory.</p>

<p>"To live with a man's elder brother," said T'ai
Wang Shan Fu,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Addressing his own people.</p></div>

<p>"and slay his younger brother; to live with a man's
father and slay his son,&mdash;this I could not bear to
do. Make shift to remain here. To be my subjects
or the subjects of these savages, where is
the difference? Besides I have heard say that we
ought not to let that which is intended to nourish
life become injurious to life."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Alluding to the "territory."</p></div>

<p>Thereupon he took his staff and went off. His
people all followed him, and they founded a new
State at the foot of Mount Ch'i.</p>

<p>Now T'ai Wang Shan Fu undoubtedly had a
proper respect for life. And those who have a
proper respect for life, if rich and powerful, do not
let that which should nourish injure the body. If
poor and lowly, they do not allow gain to involve
them in physical wear and tear.</p>

<p>But the men of the present generation who
occupy positions of power and influence, are all
afraid of losing what they have got. Directly they
see a chance of gain, away goes all care for their
bodies. Is not that a cause for confusion?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In three successive cases the people of Yüeh had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
put their prince to death. Accordingly, Shou, the
son of the last prince, was much alarmed, and fled
to Tan Hsüeh, leaving the State of Yüeh without a
ruler.</p>

<p>Shou was at first nowhere to be found, but at
length he was traced to Tan Hsüeh. He was, however,
unwilling to come forth, so they smoked him
out with moxa. They had a royal carriage ready
for him; and as Shou seized the cord to mount the
chariot, he looked up to heaven and cried, "Oh!
ruling, ruling, could I not have been spared this?"</p>

<p>It was not that Shou objected to be a prince.
He objected to the dangers associated with such
positions. Such a one was incapable of sacrificing
life to the State, and for that very reason the
people of Yüeh wanted to get him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The States of Han and Wei were struggling to
annex each other's territory when Tzŭ Hua Tzŭ
went to see prince Chao Hsi. Finding the latter
very downcast, Tzŭ Hua Tzŭ said, "Now suppose
the representatives of the various States were to
sign an agreement before your Highness, to the
effect that although cutting off the left hand would
involve loss of the right, while cutting off the right
would involve loss of the left, nevertheless that whosoever
would cut off either should be emperor over
all,&mdash;would your Highness cut?"</p>

<p>"I would not," replied the prince.</p>

<p>"Very good," said Tzŭ Hua Tzŭ. "It is clear
therefore that one's two arms are worth more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
the empire. And one's body is worth more than
one's arms, while the State of Han is infinitely less
important than the empire. Further, what you are
struggling over is of infinitely less importance than
the State of Han. Yet your Highness is wearing
out body and soul alike in fear and anxiety lest you
should not get it."</p>

<p>"Good indeed!" cried the prince. "Many have
counselled me, but I have never heard the like of
this."</p>

<p>From which we may infer that Tzŭ Hua Tzŭ
knew the difference between what was of importance
and what was not.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The prince of Lu, hearing that Yen Ho had
attained to <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, despatched messengers with
presents to open communications.</p>

<p>Yen Ho lived in a hovel. He wore clothes of
coarse grass, and occupied himself in tending oxen.</p>

<p>When the messengers arrived, Yen Ho went out
to meet them; whereupon they enquired, "Is this
where Yen Ho lives?"</p>

<p>"This is Yen Ho's house," replied the latter.</p>

<p>The messengers then produced the presents;
but Yen Ho said, "I fear you have made a mistake.
And as you might get into trouble, it would
be as well to go back and make sure."</p>

<p>This the messengers accordingly did. When
however they returned, there was no trace to be
found of Yen Ho. Thus it is that men like Yen
Ho hate wealth and power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>Wherefore it has been said that the best part of
<span class="smcap">Tao</span> is for self-culture, the surplus for governing
a State, and the dregs for governing the empire.
From which we may infer that the great deeds of
kings and princes are but the leavings of the Sage.
For preserving the body and nourishing vitality,
they are of no avail. Yet the superior men of to-day
endanger their bodies and throw away their
lives in their greed for the things of this world. Is
not this pitiable?</p>

<p>The true Sage in all his actions considers the
why and the wherefore. But there are those now-a-days
who use the pearl of the prince of Sui to shoot
a bird a thousand yards off.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A wonderfully brilliant gem, of a "ten chariot"
illuminating power.</p></div>

<p>And the world of course laughs at them. Why?
Because they sacrifice the greater to get the less.
But surely life is of more importance even than the
prince's pearl!</p>

<p>Lieh Tzŭ was poor. His face wore a hungry
look.</p>

<p>A visitor one day mentioned this to Tzŭ Yang</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Prime Minister.</p></div>

<p>of Chêng, saying, "Lieh Tzŭ is a scholar who has
attained to <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. He lives in your Excellency's
State, and yet he is poor. Can it be said that your
Excellency does not love scholars?"</p>

<p>Thereupon Tzŭ Yang gave orders that Lieh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
Tzŭ should be supplied with food. But when
Lieh Tzŭ saw the messengers, he bowed twice and
declined.</p>

<p>When the messengers had gone, and Lieh Tzŭ
went within, his wife gazed at him, and beating her
breast said, "I have heard that the wife and children
of a man of <span class="smcap">Tao</span> are happy and joyful. But
see how hungry I am. His Excellency sent you
food, and you would not take it. Is not this flying
in the face of Providence?"</p>

<p>"His Excellency did not know me personally,"
answered Lieh Tzŭ with a smile. "It was because of
what others said about me that he sent me the food.
If then men were to speak ill of me, he would also
act upon it. For that reason I refused the food."</p>

<p>Subsequently, there was trouble among the people
of Chêng, and Tzŭ Yang was slain.</p>

<p>When Prince Chao of the Ch'u State lost his
kingdom, he was followed into exile by his butcher,
named Yüeh.</p>

<p>On his restoration, as he was distributing rewards
to those who had remained faithful to him, he came
to the name of Yüeh.</p>

<p>Yüeh, however, said, "When the prince lost his
kingdom, I lost my butchery. Now that the prince
has got back his kingdom, I have got back my
butchery. I have recovered my office and salary.
What need for further reward?"</p>

<p>On hearing this, the prince gave orders that he
should be made to take his reward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was not through my fault," argued Yüeh,
"that the prince lost his kingdom, and I should
not have taken the punishment. Neither was it
through me that he got it back, and I cannot therefore
accept the reward."</p>

<p>When the prince heard this answer, he commanded
Yüeh to be brought before him. But Yüeh
said, "The laws of the Ch'u State require that a
subject shall have deserved exceptionally well of his
prince before being admitted to an audience. Now
my wisdom was insufficient to preserve this kingdom,
and my courage insufficient to destroy the
invaders. When the Wu soldiers entered Ying, I
feared for my life and fled. That was why I
followed the prince. And if now the prince wishes
to set law and custom aside and summon me to an
audience, this is not my idea of proper behaviour
on the part of the prince."</p>

<p>"Yüeh," said the prince to Tzŭ Chi, his master
of the horse, "occupies a lowly position; yet his
principles are of the most lofty. Go, make him a
San Ching."</p>

<p>"I am aware," replied Yüeh to the master of the
horse, "that the post of San Ching is more honourable
than that of butcher. And I am aware that
the emolument is larger than what I now receive.
Still, because I want preferment and salary, I
cannot let my prince earn the reputation of being
injudicious in his patronage. I must beg to decline.
Let me go back to my butchery."</p>

<p>And he adhered to his refusal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>Yüan Hsien dwelt in Lu,&mdash;in a mud hut, with a
grass-grown roof, an apology for a door, and two
mulberry-trees for door-posts. The windows which
lighted his two rooms were no bigger than the
mouth of a jar, and were closed by a wad of old
clothes. The hut leaked from above and was damp
under foot; yet Yüan Hsien sat gravely there
playing on the guitar.</p>

<p>Tzŭ Kung came driving up in a fine chariot, in a
white robe lined with purple; but the hood of the
chariot was too big for the street.</p>

<p>When he went to see Yüan Hsien, the latter
came to the door in a flowery cap, with his shoes
down at heel, and leaning on a stalk.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" cried Tzŭ Kung, "whatever
is the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"I have heard," replied Yüan Hsien, "that he
who is without wealth is called poor, and that he
who learns without being able to practise is said to
have something the matter with him. Now I am
merely poor; I have nothing the matter with me."</p>

<p>Tzŭ Kung was much abashed at this reply; upon
which Yüan Hsien smiling continued, "To try to
thrust myself forward among men; to seek friendship
in mutual flattery; to learn for the sake of
others; to teach for my own sake; to use benevolence
and duty to one's neighbour for evil ends; to
make a great show with horses and carriages,&mdash;these
things I cannot do."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tsêng Tzŭ lived in the Wei State. His wadded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
coat had no outside cloth. His face was bloated
and rough. His hands and feet were horny hard.
For three days he had had no fire; no new clothes
for ten years. If he set his cap straight the tassel
would come off. If he drew up his sleeve his elbow
would poke through. If he pulled up his shoe,
the heel would come off. Yet slipshod he sang the
<cite>Sacrificial Odes of Shang</cite>, his voice filling the
whole sky, as though it had been some instrument
of metal or stone.</p>

<p>The Son of Heaven could not secure him as a
minister. The feudal princes could not secure him
as a friend. For he who nourishes his purpose
becomes oblivious of his body. He who nourishes
his body becomes oblivious of gain. And he who
has attained <span class="smcap">Tao</span> becomes oblivious of his mind.</p>

<p>"Come hither," said Confucius to Yen Hui.
"Your family is poor, and your position lowly.
Why not go into official life?"</p>

<p>"I do not wish to," replied Yen Hui. "I have
fifty acres of land beyond the city walls, which are
enough to supply me with food. Ten more within
the walls provide me with clothes. My lute gives
me all the amusement I want; and the study of
your doctrines keeps me happy enough. I do not
desire to go into official life."</p>

<p>"Bravo! well said!" cried Confucius with beaming
countenance. "I have heard say that those
who are contented do not entangle themselves in
the pursuit of gain. That those who have really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
obtained do not fear the contingency of loss. That
those who devote themselves to cultivation of the
inner man, though occupying no position, feel no
shame. Thus indeed I have long preached. Only
now, that I have seen Yen Hui, am I conscious of
the realisation of these words."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Prince Mou of Chung-shan said to Chan Tzŭ,
"My body is in the country, but my heart is in
town. What am I to do?"</p>

<p>"Make life of paramount importance," answered
Chan Tzŭ, "and worldly advantage will cease to
have weight."</p>

<p>"That I know," replied the Prince; "but I am
not equal to the task."</p>

<p>"If you are not equal to this," said Chan Tzŭ,
"then it were well for you to pursue your natural
bent. Not to be equal to a task, and yet to force
oneself to stick to it,&mdash;this is called adding one
injury to another. And those who suffer such
two-fold injury do not belong to the class of the
long-lived."</p>

<p>Prince Mou of Wei was heir to the throne of a
large State. For him to become a hermit among
the hills was more difficult than for an ordinary
cotton-clothed scholar. And although he had not
attained to <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, he may be said to have been on the
way thither.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Confucius was caught between the Ch'êns
and the Ts'ais, he went seven days without proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
food. He ate soup of herbs, having no rice. He
looked very much exhausted, yet he sat within
playing his guitar and singing to it.</p>

<p>Yen Hui was picking over the herbs, while Tzŭ
Lu and Tzŭ Kung were talking together. One of
them said, "Our Master has twice been driven out
of Lu. They will have none of him in Wei. His
tree was cut down in Sung. He got into trouble
in Shang and Chou. And now he is surrounded
by the Ch'êns and the Ts'ais. Whoever kills him
is to be held guiltless. Whoever takes him prisoner
is not to be interfered with. Yet all the time he
goes on playing and singing without cease. Is this
the right thing for a superior man to do?"</p>

<p>Yen Hui said nothing, but went inside and told
Confucius, who laid aside his guitar and said with
a loud sigh, "Yu and Tzŭ are ignorant fellows.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These were their personal names.</p></div>

<p>Bid them come, and I will speak to them."</p>

<p>When they entered Tzŭ Lu said, "We seem to
have made a thorough failure."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" cried Confucius. "The
superior man who succeeds in <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, has success. If
he fails in <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, he makes a failure. Now I, holding
fast to the <span class="smcap">Tao</span> of charity and duty towards one's
neighbour, have fallen among the troubles of a disordered
age. What failure is there in that?</p>

<p>"Therefore it is that by cultivation of the inner
man there is no failure in <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, and when danger
comes there is no loss of virtue. It is the chill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
winter weather, it is frost, it is snow, which bring
out the luxuriance of the pine and the fir.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See <cite>Lun Yü</cite>, ix, 27.</p></div>

<p>I regard it as a positive blessing to be thus situated
as I am."</p>

<p>Thereupon he turned abruptly round and went
on playing and singing.</p>

<p>At this Tzŭ Lu hastily seized a shield and began
dancing to the music, while Tzŭ Kung said, "I had
no idea of the height of heaven and of the depth of
earth."</p>

<p>The ancients who attained <span class="smcap">Tao</span> were equally
happy under success and failure. Their happiness
had nothing to do with their failure or their success.
<span class="smcap">Tao</span> once attained, failure and success became mere
links in a chain, like cold, heat, wind, and rain.
Thus Hsü Yu enjoyed himself at Ying-yang, and
Kung Poh found happiness on the hill-top.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whither he retired after a reign of 14 years.</p></div>

<p>Shun offered to resign the empire to his friend
Pei Jen Wu Tsê.</p>

<p>"What a strange manner of man you are!" cried
the latter. "Living in the furrowed fields, you
exchanged such a life for the throne of Yao. And
as if that was not enough, you now try to heap indignity
upon me. I am ashamed of you."</p>

<p>Thereupon he drowned himself in the waters of
Ch'ing-ling.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"But how about preservation of life?" asks Lin Hsi
Chung with a sneer.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<p>When T'ang was about to attack Chieh, he went
to consult with Pien Sui.</p>

<p>"It is not a matter in which I can help you," said
the latter.</p>

<p>"Who can?" asked T'ang.</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied Pien Sui.</p>

<p>T'ang then went to consult with Wu Kuang.</p>

<p>"It is not a matter in which I can help you," said
the latter.</p>

<p>"Who can?" asked T'ang.</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied Wu Kuang.</p>

<p>"What do you think of I Yin?" asked T'ang.</p>

<p>"He forces himself," said Wu Kuang, "to put up
with obloquy. Beyond this I know nothing of him."</p>

<p>So T'ang took I Yin into his counsels. They
attacked Chieh, and vanquished him.</p>

<p>Then T'ang offered to resign the empire in favour
of Pien Sui. But Pien Sui declined, saying, "When
your Majesty consulted with me about attacking
Chieh, you evidently looked on me as a robber.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Who would steal territory. But men of <span class="smcap">Tao</span> wage
no wars.</p></div>

<p>Now that you have vanquished him, and you offer
to resign in my favour, you evidently regard me as
covetous. I was born indeed in a disordered age.
But for a man without <span class="smcap">Tao</span> to thus insult me twice,
is more than I can endure."</p>

<p>So he drowned himself in the river Chou.</p>

<p>Then T'ang offered to resign in favour of Wu
Kuang, saying, "The wise plan, the brave execute,
the good rest therein,&mdash;such was the <span class="smcap">Tao</span> of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
ancients. Why, Sir, should not you occupy the
throne?"</p>

<p>But Wu Kuang declined, saying, "To depose a
ruler is not to do one's duty to one's neighbour.
To slay the people is not charity. For others to
suffer these wrongs, while I enjoy the profits, is
not honest. I have heard say that one should not
accept a wage unless earned in accordance with
right; and that if the world is without <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, one
should not put foot upon its soil, still less rule over
it! I can bear this no longer."</p>

<p>Thereupon he took a stone on his back and
jumped into the river Lu.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the rise of the Chou dynasty there were two
scholars, named Po I and Shu Ch'i, who lived in
Ku-tu.</p>

<p>One of these said to the other, "I have heard
that in the west there are men who are apparently
in possession of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. Let us go and see them."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Meaning the men of Chou.</p></div>

<p>When they arrived at Ch'i-yang, Wu Wang</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The writer meant Wên Wang, father of Wu Wang.</p></div>

<p>heard of their arrival and sent Shu Tan</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Chou Kung.</p></div>

<p>to enter into a treaty with them. They were to
receive emoluments of the second degree and rank
of the first degree. The treaty was to be sealed
with blood and buried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>

<p>At this the two looked at each other and smiled.
"Ah!" said one of them, "this is strange indeed.
It is not what we call <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p>

<p>"When Shên Nung ruled the empire, he worshipped
God without asking for any reward. Sometimes
it was the law he put in force; sometimes it
was his personal influence he brought to bear. He
was loyal and faithful to his people without seeking
any return. He did not build his success upon
another's ruin, nor mount high by means of
another's fall, nor seize opportunities to secure his
own advantage.</p>

<p>"But now that the Chous, beholding the iniquities
of the Yins, have taken upon themselves to
govern, we have intrigues above and bribes below.
Troops are mobilised to protect prestige. Victims
are slaughtered to give good faith to a treaty. A
show of virtue is made to amuse the masses.
Fighting and slaughter are made the means of
gain. Confusion has simply been exchanged for
disorder.</p>

<p>"I have heard tell that the men of old, living in
quiet times, never shirked their duties; but lighting
upon troublous times, nothing could make them
stay. The empire is now in darkness. The virtue
of the Chous has faded. For the empire to be
united under the Chous would be a disgrace to us.
Better flee away and keep our actions pure."</p>

<p>Accordingly, these two philosophers went north
to Mount Shou-yang, where they subsequently
starved themselves to death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p>Men like Poh I and Shu Ch'i, if wealth and
honour came to them so that they could properly
accept, would assuredly not have recourse to such
heroic measures, nor would they be content to
follow their own bent, without giving their services
to their generation. Such was the purity of these
two scholars.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Robber Chê.</span></p>

<p class="ph4">[Spurious.]</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Confucius</span> was on terms of friendship with
Liu Hsia Chi, whose younger brother was
known as "Robber Chê."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is an anachronism. Liu Hsia Chi (<em>or</em> Hui)
was a virtuous official of the Lu State. He flourished
some 80 and more years before the time of Confucius.</p></div>

<p>Robber Chê had a band of followers nine thousand
strong. He ravaged the whole empire,
plundering the various nobles and breaking into
people's houses. He drove off oxen and horses.
He stole men's wives and daughters. Family ties
put no limit to his greed. He had no respect for
parents nor for brothers. He neglected the worship
of his ancestors. Wherever he passed, the greater
States flew to arms, the smaller ones to places of
safety. All the people were sore distressed.</p>

<p>"A father," said Confucius to Liu Hsia Chi,
"should surely be able to admonish his son; an
elder brother to teach his younger brother. If this
be not so, there is an end of the value attached to
these relationships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now you, Sir, are one of the scholars of the
age, while your younger brother is the Robber Chê,
the scourge of the empire. You are unable to teach
him, and I blush for you. Let me go and have a
talk with him on your behalf."</p>

<p>"As to what you say, Sir, about fathers and elder
brothers," answered Liu Hsia Chi, "if the son will
not listen to his father, nor the younger brother to
his elder brother, what becomes of your arguments
then?</p>

<p>"Besides, Chê's passions are like a bubbling
spring. His thoughts are like a whirlwind. He is
strong enough to defy all foes. He can argue until
wrong becomes right. If you follow his inclinations,
he is pleased. If you oppose them he is angry.
He is free with the language of abuse. Do not go
near him."</p>

<p>Confucius paid no attention to this advice; but
with Yen Hui as charioteer and Tzŭ Kung on his
right, went off to see Robber Chê.</p>

<p>The latter had just encamped to the south of
T'ai-shan, and was engaged in devouring a dish of
minced human liver. Confucius alighted from his
chariot, and advancing addressed the doorkeeper as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am Confucius of the Lu State. I have heard
of the high character of your captain."</p>

<p>He then twice respectfully saluted the doorkeeper,
who went in to announce his arrival.</p>

<p>When Robber Chê heard who it was, he was
furious. His eyes glared like stars. His hair raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
his cap from his head as he cried out, "What! that
crafty scoundrel Confucius of Lu? Go, tell him
from me that he is a mere word-mongerer. That he
talks nonsense about Wên Wang and Wu Wang.
That he wears an extravagant cap, with a thong
from the side of a dead ox. That what he says is
mostly rhodomontade. That he consumes where he
does not sow, and wears clothes he does not weave.
That his lips patter and his tongue wags. That his
rights and wrongs are of his own coining, whereby
he throws dust in the eyes of rulers and prevents
the scholars of the empire from reverting to the
original source of all things.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Sc.</i> <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p></div>

<p>That he makes a great stir about filial piety and
brotherly love, glad enough himself to secure some
fat fief or post of power. Tell him that he deserves
the worst, and that if he does not take himself off
his liver shall be in my morning stew."</p>

<p>But Confucius sent in again, saying, "I am a
friend of Liu Hsia Chi. I am anxious to set eyes
upon your captain's shoe-strings."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Another interpretation is "upon your captain's feet
visible from beneath the screen."</p></div>

<p>When the doorkeeper gave this second message,
Robber Chê said, "Bring him before me!" Thereupon
Confucius hurried in, and avoiding the place
of honour stepped back and made two obeisances.</p>

<p>Robber Chê, flaming with anger, straddled out
his two legs, and laying his hand upon his sword<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
glared at Confucius and roaring like a tigress with
young, said, "Ch'iu! come here. If what you
say suits my ideas, you will live. Otherwise you
will die."</p>

<p>"I have heard," replied Confucius, "that the
world contains three classes of virtue. To grow up
tall, of a beauty without compare, and thus to be
the idol of young and old, of noble and lowly alike,&mdash;this
is the highest class. To be possessed of
wisdom which embraces the universe and can explain
all things,&mdash;this is the middle class. To be
possessed of courage which will stand test and
gather followers around,&mdash;this is the lowest class.</p>

<p>"Now any man whose virtue belongs to either of
these classes is fit to occupy the place and title of
ruler. But you, Captain, unite all three in yourself.
You are eight feet two in height. Your expression
is very bright. Your lips are like vermilion. Your
teeth like a row of shells. Your voice is like a
beautiful bell;&mdash;yet you are known as Robber Chê.
Captain, I blush for you.</p>

<p>"Captain, if you will hearken to me I will go
south for you to Wu and Yüeh, north to Ch'i
and Lu, east to Sung and Wei, and west to Chin
and Ch'u. I will have a great wall built for
you of many <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i> in extent, enclosing hamlets of
many hundreds of thousands of inhabitants, over
which State you shall be ruler. Your relations
with the empire will enter upon a new phase. You
will disband your men. You will gather your
brothers around you. You will join in worship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
of your ancestors. Such is the behaviour of the
true Sage and the man of parts, and such is what
the world desires."</p>

<p>"Ch'iu! come here," cried Robber Chê in a great
rage. "Those who are squared by offers and corrected
by words are the stupid vulgar masses. The
height and the beauty which you praise in me are
legacies from my parents. Even though you did
not praise them, do you think I should be ignorant
of their existence? Besides, those who flatter to
the face speak evil behind the back. Now all you
have been saying about the great State and its
numerous population simply means squaring me
by offers as though one of the common herd. And
of course it would not last.</p>

<p>"There is no State bigger than the empire. Yao
and Shun both got this, yet their descendants have
not territory enough to insert an awl's point. T'ang
and Wu Wang both sat upon the Imperial throne,
yet their posterity has been obliterated from the face
of the earth.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Hardly in Chuang Tzŭ's time.</p></div>

<p>Was not this because of the very magnitude of the
prize?</p>

<p>"I have also heard that in olden times the birds
and animals outnumbered man, and that the latter
was obliged to seek his safety by building his domicile
in trees. By day he picked up acorns and
chestnuts. At night he slept upon a branch. Hence
the name <em>Nest-builders</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of old, the people did not know how to make
clothes. In summer they collected quantities of fuel,
and in winter warmed themselves by fire. Hence
the name <em>Provident</em>.</p>

<p>"In the days of Shên Nung, they lay down
without caring where they were and got up without
caring whither they might go. A man knew his
mother but not his father. He lived among the
wild deer. He tilled the ground for food. He wove
cloth to cover his body. He harboured no thought
of injury to others. These were the glorious results
of an age of perfect virtue.</p>

<p>"The Yellow Emperor, however, could not attain
to this virtue. He fought with Ch'ih Yu at Chŏ-lu,
and blood flowed for a hundred <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i>. Then came
Yao and Shun with their crowd of ministers. Then
T'ang who deposed his sovereign, and Wu Wang
who slew Chou. After which time the strong took
to oppressing the weak, the many to coercing the
few. In fact, ever since T'ang and Wu Wang we
have had none other than disturbers of the peace.</p>

<p>"And now you come forward preaching the old
dogmas of Wên Wang and palming off sophistries
without end, in order to teach future generations.
You wear patched clothes and a narrow girdle, you
talk big and act falsely, in order to deceive the
rulers of the land, while all the time you yourself
are aiming at wealth and power! You are the
biggest thief I know of; and if the world calls me
Robber Chê, it most certainly ought to call you
Robber Ch'iu.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>"By fair words you enticed Tzŭ Lu to follow
you. You made him doff his martial cap,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Shaped like a cock's comb.</p></div>

<p>and ungird his long sword, and sit a disciple at
your feet. And all the world cried out that Confucius
could stop violence and prevent wrong-doing.
By and by, when Tzŭ Lu wished to slay the prince
of Wei, but failed, and was himself hacked to pieces
and exposed over the eastern gate of Wei,&mdash;that
was because you had not properly instructed him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See the account in the <cite>Tso Chuan</cite>.</p></div>

<p>"You call yourself a man of talent and a Sage
forsooth! Twice you have been driven out of Lu.
You were tabooed in Wei. You were a failure in
Ch'i. You were surrounded by the Ch'êns and the
Ts'ais. In fact, the empire won't have you anywhere.
It was your teaching which brought Tzŭ
Lu to his tragical end. You cannot take care, in
the first place, of yourself, nor, in the second place,
of others. Of what value can your doctrine be?</p>

<p>"There is none to whom mankind has accorded
a higher place than to the Yellow Emperor. Yet
his virtue was not complete. He fought at Chŏ-lu,
and blood ran for a hundred <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i>. Yao was not
paternal.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He killed his eldest son.</p></div>

<p>Shun was not filial.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He banished his mother's younger brother.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>The great Yü was deficient in one respect.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He was wanting in natural feeling. When engaged
in his great engineering work of draining the empire,
he even passed his own door without going in to see
his family.</p></div>

<p>T'ang deposed his sovereign. Wu Wang vanquished
Chou. Wên Wang was imprisoned at
Yin Li.</p>

<p>"Now these six worthies enjoy a high reputation
among men. Yet a fuller investigation shows that
in each case a desire for advantage disturbed their
original purity and forced it into a contrary direction.
Hence the shamelessness of their deeds.</p>

<p>"Among those whom the world calls virtuous
were Poh I and Shu Ch'i. They declined the
sovereignty of Ku-chu and died of starvation on
Mount Shou-yang, their corpses deprived of
burial.</p>

<p>"Pao Chiao made a great show of virtue and
abused the world in general. He grasped a tree
and died.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Tzŭ Kung, one of Confucius' disciples, is said to
have scolded Pao Chiao so vigorously that the latter
withered up into dead wood.</p></div>

<p>"Shên T'u Ti, when no heed was paid to his
counsels, jumped into the river with a stone on his
back and became food for fishes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See p. <a href="#Page_72">72</a>.</p></div>

<p>"Chieh Tzŭ T'ui was truly loyal. He cut a slice
from his thigh to feed Wên Wang. Afterwards,
when Wên Wang turned his back upon him, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
retired in anger, and grasping a tree, was burnt to
death.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He took refuge in a forest, from which Wên Wang,
anxious to recover his friend, tried to smoke him
out!</p></div>

<p>"Wei Shêng made an assignation with a girl
beneath a bridge. The girl did not come, and the
water rose. But Wei Shêng would not leave. He
grasped a buttress and died.</p>

<p>"These four differed in no way from dogs and
pigs going about begging to be slaughtered. They
all exaggerated reputation and disregarded death.
They did not reflect upon their original nature and
seek to preserve life into the old age allotted.</p>

<p>"Among ministers whom the world calls loyal,
none can compare with Wang Tzŭ, Pi Kan, and
Wu Tzŭ Hsü. The last-mentioned drowned himself.
Pi Kan was disembowelled. These two
worthies are what men call loyal ministers; yet, as
a matter of fact, all the world laughs at them!</p>

<p>"Thus, from the most ancient times down to
Tzŭ Hsü and Pi Kan, there have been none deserving
of honour. And as to the sermon you,
Ch'iu, propose to preach to me,&mdash;if it is on ghostly
subjects, I shan't understand them, and if it is on
human affairs, why there is nothing more to be
said. I know it all already.</p>

<p>"I will now tell you a few things. The lust of
the eye is for beauty. The lust of the ear is for
music. The lust of the palate is for flavour. The
lust of ambition is for gratification. Man's greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
age is one hundred years. A medium old age is
eighty years. The lowest estimate is sixty years.
Take away from this the hours of sickness, disease,
death, mourning, sorrow, and trouble, and there
will not remain more than four or five days a
month upon which a man may open his mouth to
laugh. Heaven and Earth are everlasting. Sooner
or later every man has to die. That which thus
has a limit, as compared with that which is everlasting,
is a mere flash, like the passage of some

cannot gratify their ambition and live through
their allotted span, are men who have not attained
to <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p>

<p>"Ch'iu! all your teachings are nothing to me.
Begone! Go home! Say no more! Your doctrine
is a random jargon, full of falsity and deceit. It can
never preserve the original purity of man. Why
discuss it further?"</p>

<p>Confucius made two obeisances and hurriedly
took his leave. On mounting his chariot, he three
times missed hold of the reins. His eyes were so
dazed that he could see nothing. His face was
ashy pale. With down-cast head he grasped the
bar of his chariot, unable to find vent for his
feelings.</p>

<p>Arriving outside the eastern gate of Lu, he met
Liu Hsia Chi, who said, "I have not seen you for
some days. From the look of your equipage I
should say you had been travelling. I guess now
you have been to see Chê."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>Confucius looked up to heaven, and replied with
a sigh, "I have."</p>

<p>"And did he not rebuff you," asked Liu Hsia
Chi, "as I said he would?"</p>

<p>"He did," said Confucius. "I am a man who
has cauterized himself without being ill. I hurried
away to smooth the tiger's head and comb out his
beard. And I very nearly got into the tiger's
mouth."</p>

<p>Tzŭ Chang asked Man Kou Tê,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Which means "Full of the Ill-gotten."</p></div>

<p>saying, "Why do you not practise virtue? Otherwise,
it is impossible to inspire confidence. And
without confidence, no place. And without place,
no wealth. Thus, with a view to reputation or to
wealth, duty towards one's neighbour is the true
key.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As leading to reputation, which was what Tzŭ Chang
wanted.</p></div>

<p>If you were to discard all thoughts of reputation
and wealth and attend to the cultivation of the
heart, surely you would not pass one day without
practising the higher virtues."</p>

<p>"Those who have no shame," replied Man Kou
Tê,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Meaning himself.</p></div>

<p>"grow rich. Those who inspire confidence make
themselves conspicuous.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Meaning Tzŭ Chang.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>Reputation and wealth are mostly to be got out of
shamelessness and confidence inspired. Thus, with
a view to reputation or to wealth, the confidence of
others is the true key.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As leading to wealth, which was what Man Kou Tê
wanted.</p></div>

<p>If you were to discard all thoughts of reputation
and wealth, surely the virtuous man would then
have no scope beyond himself."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Beyond his own nature.</p></div>

<p>"Of old," said Tzŭ Chang, "Chieh and Chou
sat upon the Imperial throne, and the whole empire
was theirs. Yet if you were now to tell any common
thief that his moral qualities resembled theirs,
he would resent it as an insult. By such miserable
creatures are they despised."</p>

<p>"Confucius and Mih Tzŭ, on the other hand,
were poor and simple enough. Yet if you were to
tell any Prime Minister of to-day that his moral
qualities resembled theirs, he would flush with
pride and declare you were paying him too high a
compliment. So truly honourable is the man of
learning.</p>

<p>"Thus, the power of a monarch does not necessarily
make him worthy; nor do poverty and a low
station necessarily make a man unworthy. The
worthy and the unworthy are differentiated by the
worthiness and unworthiness of their acts."</p>

<p>"A petty thief," replied Man Kou Tê, "is put in
gaol. A great brigand becomes ruler of a State.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
And among the retainers of the latter, men of virtue
will be found.</p>

<p>"Of old, Duke Huan, named Hsiao Poh, slew
his elder brother and took his sister-in-law to wife.
Yet Kuan Chung became his minister.</p>

<p>"T'ien Ch'êng Tzŭ killed his prince and seized
the kingdom. Yet Confucius accepted his pay.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See p. <a href="#Page_111">111</a>.</p></div>

<p>"To condemn a man in words, yet actually to
take service under him,&mdash;does not this show us
practice and precept directly opposed to one
another?</p>

<p>"Therefore it was written, 'Who is bad? Who
is good? He who succeeds is the head. He who
does not succeed is the tail.'"</p>

<p>"But if you do not practise virtue," said Tzŭ
Chang, "and make no distinction between kith
and kin, assign no duties to the worthy and to the
unworthy, no precedence to young and old, how
then are the Five Bonds and the Six Ranks to be
distinguished?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Commentators are divided as to these Bonds and
Ranks. One makes the former calendaric. Another
considers that the five cardinal virtues and six ranks
of nobility are meant. Of the latter there are only
five, but "sovereign" is added to patch the deficiency.</p></div>

<p>"Yao slew his eldest son," answered Man Kou
Tê. "Shun banished his mother's brother. Was
there kith and kin in that?</p>

<p>"T'ang deposed Chieh. Wu Wang slew Chou.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
Was that the duty of the worthy towards the unworthy?</p>

<p>"Wang Chi was the legitimate heir, but Chow
Kung slew his elder brother. Was that precedence
of young and old?</p>

<p>"The false principles of the Confucianists, the
universal love of the Mihists,&mdash;do these help to
distinguish the Five Bonds and the Six Ranks?</p>

<p>"You, Sir, are all for reputation. I am all for
wealth. As to which pursuit is not in accordance
with principle nor in harmony with right, let us
refer to the arbitration of Wu Yoh."</p>

<p>"The mean man," said Wu Yoh, "devotes himself
to wealth. The superior man devotes himself
to reputation. The moral results are different in
each case. But if both would set aside their activities
and devote themselves to doing nothing, the
results would be the same.</p>

<p>"Wherefore it has been said, 'Be not a mean
man. Revert to your natural self. Be not a superior
man. Abide by the laws of heaven.'</p>

<p>"As to the straight and the crooked, view them
from the standpoint of the infinite.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All distinctions are thus merged.</p></div>

<p>Gaze around you on all sides, until time withdraws
you from the scene.</p>

<p>"As to the right and the wrong, hold fast to
your magic circle,</p>

<p>"The above instances have been handed down
to us from antiquity and are discussed in modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
times. They show that men of learning emphasized
their precepts by carrying them out in
practice; and that consequently they paid the
penalty and fell into these calamities."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Discontent asked Complacency, saying, "There
is really no one who does not either aim at reputation
or make for wealth. If a man is rich, others
flock around him. These necessarily take a subordinate
position, and consequently pay him court.
And it would seem that such subordination and
respect constitute a royal road to long life, comfort,
and general happiness. How is it then that you,
Sir, have no mind for these things? Is it that you
are wanting in wit? Or is it that you are physically
unable to compete, and therefore go in for
being virtuous, though all the time unable to
forget?"</p>

<p>"You and your friends," replied Complacency,
"regard all men as alike because they happen to be
born at the same time and in the same place as
yourselves. You look on us as scholars who have
separated from humanity and cast off the world,
and who have no guiding principle beyond poring
over the records of the past and present, or indulging
in the logomachy of this and that.</p>

<p>"Were we to lead the mundane lives you do,
it would be at the sacrifice of the very conditions
of existence. And surely thus we should be wandering
far from the royal road to long life, comfort,
and general happiness. The discomfort of wretch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>edness,
the comfort of well-being, you do not refer
to the body.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But to some external cause of which the body
becomes subjectively conscious.</p></div>

<p>The abjectness of terror, the elation of joy, you do
not refer to the mind itself. You know that such
things are so, but you do not know how they are
so. Wherefore, though equalling the Son of
Heaven in power, and with all the empire as your
personal property, you would not be free from
care."</p>

<p>"Wealth," replied Discontent, "is of the greatest
service to a man. It enables him to do good, and
to exert power, to an extent which the perfect man
or the true Sage could never reach. He can borrow
the courage and strength of others to make himself
formidable. He can employ the wisdom and counsels
of others to add clearness to his own deliberations.
He can avail himself of the virtue of others
and cause it to appear as his own. Without being
in possession of a throne, he can wield the authority
of a prince.</p>

<p>"Besides, the pleasures of music, beauty, rich
food, and power, do not require to be studied before
they can be appreciated by the mind; nor does the
body need the example of others before it can enjoy
them. We need no teacher to tell us what to like
or dislike, to follow or to avoid. Such knowledge
is instinctive in man. The world may condemn
this view, but which of us is free from the taint?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>"The wise man," answered Complacency, "acts
for the common weal, in pursuit of which he does
not overstep due limits. Wherefore, if there is a
sufficiency, he does not strive for more. He has no
use for more, and accordingly does not seek it. But
if there is not a sufficiency, then he seeks for more.
He strives in all directions, yet does not account it
greed. If there is a surplus, he declines it. Even
though he refused the whole empire, he would not
account it honesty. To him, honesty and greed are
not conditions into which we are forced by outward
circumstances, but characteristics innate in the individual.
He may wield the power of the Son of
Heaven, but will not employ it for the degradation
of others. He may own the whole empire, yet will
not use his wealth to take advantage of his fellows.
But a calculation of the troubles and the anxieties
inseparable therefrom, cause him to reject these as
injurious to his nature, not from a desire for
reputation.</p>

<p>"When Yao and Shun occupied the throne, there
was peace. They did not try to be beneficent rulers.
They did not inflict injury by doing good.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They were simply natural, and good results followed.</p></div>

<p>"Shan Chüan and Hsü Yu both declined the
proffered throne. Theirs was no empty refusal.
They would not cause injury to themselves.</p>

<p>"In all these cases, each individual adopted the
profitable course in preference to the injurious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
course. And the world calls them virtuous,
whereby they acquire a reputation at which they
never aimed."</p>

<p>"It is necessary," argued Discontent, "to cling
to reputation. If all pleasures are to be denied to
the body and one's energies to be concentrated upon
health with a view to the prolongation of life, such
life would be itself nothing more than the prolonged
illness of a confirmed invalid."</p>

<p>"Happiness," said Complacency, "is to be found
in contentment. Too much is always a curse, most
of all in wealth.</p>

<p>"The ears of the wealthy man ring with sounds
of sweet music. His palate is cloyed with rich
meats and wine. In the pursuit of pleasure, business
is forgotten. This is confusion.</p>

<p>"He eats and drinks to excess, until his breathing
is that of one carrying a heavy load up a hill.
This is misery.</p>

<p>"He covets money to surround himself with
comforts. He covets power to vanquish rivals. But
his quiet hours are darkened by diabetes and dropsy.
This is disease.</p>

<p>"Even when, in his desire for wealth, he has
piled up an enormous fortune, he still goes on and
cannot desist. This is shame.</p>

<p>"Having no use for the money he has collected,
he still hugs it to him and cannot bear to part with
it. His heart is inflamed, and he ever seeks to add
more to the pile. This is unhappiness.</p>

<p>"At home, he dreads the pest of the pilfering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
thief. Abroad, the danger of bandit and highwayman.
So he keeps strict guard within, while never
venturing alone without. This is fear.</p>

<p>"These six are the greatest of the world's curses.
Yet such a man never bestows a thought upon
them, until the hour of misfortune is at hand.
Then, with his ambitions gratified, his natural
powers exhausted, and nothing but wealth remaining,
he would gladly obtain one day's peace, but
cannot do so.</p>

<p>"Wherefore, if reputation is not to be enjoyed
and wealth is not to be secured, how pitiable it is
that men should harass their minds and wear out
their bodies in such pursuits!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">On Swords.</span></p>

<p class="ph4">[Spurious.]</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Of</span> old, Wên Wang of Chao loved sword-play.
Swordsmen thronged his halls, to the number
of three thousand and more. Day and night they
had bouts before the prince. In the course of a
year, a hundred or so would be killed or wounded.
Yet the prince was never satisfied.</p>

<p>Within three years, the State had begun to go to
rack and ruin, and other princes to form designs
upon it. Thereupon the Heir Apparent, Li, became
troubled in mind; and said to the officers of his
household, "Whosoever shall persuade the prince to
do away with these swordsmen, to him I will give
a thousand ounces of silver."</p>

<p>To this his officers replied, "Chuang Tzŭ is the
man."</p>

<p>Thereupon the Heir Apparent sent messengers to
Chuang Tzŭ with a thousand ounces of silver, which
he would not accept, but accompanied the messengers
back to their master.</p>

<p>"What does your Highness require of me,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
asked Chuang Tzŭ, "that you should bestow upon
me a thousand ounces?"</p>

<p>"I had heard," replied the young prince, "that
you were a famous Sage, and I ventured to send
this money as a present to your servants.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Merely a ceremonious phrase.</p></div>

<p>But as you would not receive it, what more can I
say?"</p>

<p>"I understand," answered Chuang Tzŭ, "that
your Highness would have me cure the prince of
his peculiar weakness. Now suppose that I do not
succeed with the prince, and consequently with
your Highness, the punishment of death is what I
have to expect. What good would the thousand
ounces be to me then?"</p>

<p>"On the other hand, if I succeed with the prince,
and consequently with your Highness, the whole
State of Chao contains nothing I could not have for
the asking."</p>

<p>"You must know, however," said the young
prince, "that my father will only receive swordsmen."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Chuang Tzŭ, "I am a good
swordsman myself."</p>

<p>"Besides which," added the Heir Apparent, "the
swordsmen he is accustomed to see have all dishevelled
hair hanging over their temples. They
wear slouching caps with coarse tangled tassels,
and short-tailed coats. They glare with their eyes
and talk in a fierce tone. This is what my father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
likes. But if you go to him dressed in your
ordinary scholar's dress, the result is sure to be
disastrous."</p>

<p>"I will accustom myself to the dress," replied
Chuang Tzŭ; and after practising for three days,
he went again to see the young prince, who accompanied
him into his father's presence.</p>

<p>The latter drew a sharp sword and awaited
Chuang Tzŭ's approach. But Chuang Tzŭ, when
he entered the door of the audience chamber, did
not hurry forward, neither did he prostrate himself
before the prince.</p>

<p>"What have you to say to me," cried the prince,
"that you have obtained your introduction through
the Heir Apparent?"</p>

<p>"I have heard," replied Chuang Tzŭ, "that your
Highness loves sword-play. Therefore I have come
to exhibit my skill."</p>

<p>"What can you do in that line?" asked the
prince.</p>

<p>"Were I to meet an opponent," said Chuang
Tzŭ, "at every ten paces, I could go on for a thousand
<i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i> without being stopped."</p>

<p>"Bravo!" cried the prince. "There is not your
match in the empire."</p>

<p>"When I fight," continued Chuang Tzŭ, "I
make a show of being weak but push a vigorous
attack. The last to start, I am the first to arrive.
I should like your Highness to make trial of me."</p>

<p>"Rest awhile," replied the prince. "Stay here
and await orders. I will arrange a day for you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>

<p>Thereupon the prince spent seven days in trying
his swordsmen. Some sixty of them were either
killed or wounded, but at length he selected five or
six and bade them attend in the audience-chamber
with their swords. He then summoned Chuang
Tzŭ and said, "Now I will see what your swordsmanship
is worth."</p>

<p>"I have been longing for this," replied Chuang
Tzŭ.</p>

<p>"Does it matter to you," asked the prince, "of
what length your weapon may be?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Chuang Tzŭ. "I have
three swords, of which I will ask your Highness to
choose one. We will then proceed to the trial."</p>

<p>"Which are your three swords?" enquired the
prince.</p>

<p>"There is the sword of the Son of Heaven," said
Chuang Tzŭ, "the sword of the Princes, and the
sword of the People."</p>

<p>"What is the sword of the Son of Heaven?"
asked the prince.</p>

<p>"The stone wall of Yen-ch'i is its point," replied
Chuang Tzŭ.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some take "stone wall" as the name of a place.</p></div>

<p>"The mountains of Ch'i are its edge. Chin and Wei
are its back. Chou and Sung are its hilt. Han and
Wei are its sheath. It is enclosed in the four
hordes of barbarians, wrapped in the four seasons,
surrounded by the great ocean. It is made of the
five elements. It is the arbiter of punishment and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
reward. It operates under the influence of the Yin
and the Yang. In spring and summer it is at rest.
In autumn and winter it moves abroad. Push it,
it does not advance. Raise it, it does not go up.
Lower it, it does not go down. Whirl it around,
it does not change position. Above, it cleaves the
floating clouds; below, it cuts through the density
of earth. One flash of this blade, and the princes
of the empire submit. Such is the sword of the Son
of Heaven."</p>

<p>At this the prince seemed absorbed in his reflections.
Then he enquired, saying, "And what is
the sword of the Princes?"</p>

<p>"The Wise and brave," replied Chuang Tzŭ,
"are its point. The incorruptible are its edge.
The virtuous are its back. The loyal are its hilt.
The heroic are its sheath. You may push this
sword too, it will not advance. Raise it, it will not
go up. Lower it, it will not go down. Whirl it
around, it will not change position. Above, it
models itself upon the round heaven, in order to
keep in harmony with the sun, moon, and stars.
Below, it models itself upon the square earth, in
order to keep in harmony with the four seasons.
It adapts itself to the wishes of the people, in
order to diffuse peace on all sides. One flash
of this blade is like a roaring clap of thunder.
Between the boundaries of the State there is
not left one but who yields and obeys the
command of his prince. Such is the sword of the
Princes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>"And the sword of the People?" enquired the
prince.</p>

<p>"The sword of the People," replied Chuang Tzŭ,
"has dishevelled hair hanging over its temples. It
wears a slouching cap with coarse tangled tassel,
and a short-tailed coat. It glares with its eyes and
talks in a fierce tone. When it engages in conflict,
above, it cuts off head and neck; below, it smites
liver and lungs. Such is the sword of the People.
It is like a game-cock. One day, its life is cut
short, and it is of no more use to the State.</p>

<p>"Now you, great prince, wield sovereign power,
and yet you devote yourself to this sword of the
People. I am truly ashamed of it."</p>

<p>Thereupon the prince drew Chuang Tzŭ up on to
the dais, and the attendants served food, the king
three times assisting with his own hand.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The prince each time received the dish from the
attendants, handed it to Chuang Tzŭ, and then
walked <em>round</em> to his own seat again.</p></div>

<p>"Be seated, great prince," said Chuang Tzŭ,
"and compose your mind. I have said all I have
to say on swords."</p>

<p>After this the prince did not quit his palace for
three months, while the swordsmen, submitting to
the new order of things, died in their own homes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One commentator says "killed themselves in their
own dwellings." But if so, Chuang Tzŭ's influence
was of small practical value as far as the swordsmen
were concerned. They might as well have continued
their profession of arms.</p></div>

<p class="ph4">[Spurious.]</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Confucius</span>, travelling in the Black Forest,
rested awhile at Apricot Altar. His disciples
sat down to their books, and he himself played
upon the lute and sang.</p>

<p>Half way through the song, an old fisherman
stepped out of a boat and advanced towards them.
His beard and eyebrows were snowy white. His
hair hung loose, and he flapped his long sleeves as
he walked over the foreshore. Reaching firm
ground, he stood still, and with left hand on his
knee and right hand to his ear, listened.</p>

<p>When the song was finished, he beckoned to Tzŭ
Kung and Tzŭ Lu, both of whom went to him.
Then pointing with his finger, he enquired, saying,
"What is that man doing here?"</p>

towards his neighbour. He regulates ceremonies and
music. He distinguishes the relationships of man.
He is loyal to his prince above, a reformer of the
masses below. Thus he will be of great service to
the whole empire. Such is his occupation."</p>

<p>"Is he a ruler of a State?" asked the old man.</p>

<p>"He is not," said Tzŭ Kung.</p>

<p>"A minister?" said the old man.</p>

<p>"No," said Tzŭ Kung.</p>

<p>Then the old man laughed and walked away,
saying, "Charity is charity, yet I fear he will not
escape the wear of mind and tear of body which
imperil the original purity of man. How far,
alas, has he wandered from the true path!"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p></div>

<p>Tzŭ Kung went back and told Confucius, who,
laying aside his lute, arose and said, "This man is
a Sage!"</p>

<p>Thereupon he followed the old man down the
shore, catching him up just as he was drawing in
his boat with his staff. Perceiving Confucius, the
old man turned round to receive him, at which Confucius
stepped back and prostrated himself twice
before advancing.</p>

<p>"What do you want, Sir?" asked the fisherman.</p>

<p>"Just now, venerable Sir," replied Confucius,
"you left without finishing your remarks. In my
stupidity I cannot make out what you mean.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
Therefore I have come in the humble hope of
hearing any words with which you may deign to
help me."</p>

<p>"Well," said the old man, "you are certainly
anxious to learn."</p>

<p>At this Confucius prostrated himself twice, and
when he got up said, "Yes, I have been a student
from my youth upwards until now, the sixty-ninth
year of my age. Yet I have never heard the true
doctrine, which I am now ready to receive without
bias."</p>

<p>"Like species follow like," answered the old man.
"Like sounds respond to like.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See p. <a href="#Page_283">283</a>, and the experiment of the two lutes,
p. <a href="#Page_319">319</a>.</p></div>

<p>This is a law of nature. I will now with your leave
apply what I know to what you occupy yourself
with,&mdash;the affairs of men.</p>

<p>"The Son of Heaven, the princes, the ministers,
and the people,&mdash;if these four fulfil their proper
functions, the result is good government. If they
quit their proper places, the result is unutterable
confusion. When the officials mind their duties
and the people their business, neither is injured by
the other.</p>

<p>"Barren land, leaky roofs, want of food and
clothing, inability to meet taxation, quarrels of
wives and concubines, no precedence between young
and old,&mdash;such are the sorrows of the people.</p>

<p>"Capacity unequal to one's duties, and inability
to carry on routine work, absence of clean-handed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>ness,
and carelessness among subordinates, lack of
distinction and want of preferment,&mdash;such are the
sorrows of ministers.</p>

<p>"The Court without loyal ministers and the
State in rebellion, the artisan unskilful and the
tribute unsatisfactory, the periodical levées unattended
and the Son of Heaven displeased,&mdash;such
are the sorrows of the princes.</p>

<p>"The two great principles of nature working
inharmoniously, heat and cold coming at irregular
seasons so that men and things suffer, the princes
rebellious and fighting among themselves so that
the people perish, music and ceremonies ill regulated,
wealth dissipated, the relationships of man
disregarded, the masses sunk in immorality,&mdash;such
are the sorrows which fall to the share of the Son
of Heaven.</p>

<p>"But now you, Sir, occupying neither the more
exalted position of ruler nor performing the subordinate
functions of minister, nevertheless take upon
yourself to regulate music and ceremonies and to
distinguish the relationships of man, in order to
reform the masses. Are you not travelling out of
your own sphere?</p>

<p>"Further, men have eight blemishes, and there
are four things which obstruct business. These
should be investigated.</p>

<p>"Meddling with matters which do not matter to
you, is prying.</p>

<p>"To push one's way in, regardless of neglect, is
to be forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<p>"To adapt one's thoughts and arrange one's
words, is sycophancy.</p>

<p>"To applaud a person, right or wrong, is
flattery.</p>

<p>"To love speaking evil of others, is slander.</p>

<p>"To sever friendships and break ties, is mischievousness.</p>

<p>"To praise people falsely with a view to injure
them, is malice.</p>

<p>"To give ready assent with a view to worm out
the wishes of others, good and bad alike, is to be a
hypocrite.</p>

<p>"These eight blemishes cause a man to throw
others into confusion and bring injury upon himself.
The superior man will not have him for a
friend; the enlightened prince will not employ him
as his minister.</p>

<p>"To love the conduct of great affairs, and to introduce
change into established order with a view
to gain reputation,&mdash;this is ambition.</p>

<p>"To strive to get all into one's own hands, and to
usurp what should be at the disposal of others,&mdash;this
is greed.</p>

<p>"To know one's faults but not to correct them, to
receive admonition but only to plunge deeper,&mdash;this
is obstinacy.</p>

<p>"To suffer those who are like oneself, but as for
those unlike not to credit them with the virtues
they really possess,&mdash;this is bigotry.</p>

<p>"Such are the four things which obstruct business.
And only he who can put aside the above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
eight and abstain from the above four is fit for
instruction."</p>

<p>At this Confucius heaved a sigh of distress.
Then having twice prostrated himself, he arose and
said, "Twice was I driven from Lu. I was tabooed
in Wei. My tree was cut down in Sung. I was
surrounded by the Ch'êns and the Ts'ais. I know
not what my fault is that I should have suffered
these four persecutions."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said the old man in a vexed tone,
"How slow of perception you are.</p>

<p>"There was once a man who was so afraid of his
shadow and so disliked his own footsteps that he
determined to run away from them. But the oftener
he raised his feet the more footsteps he made, and
though he ran very hard his shadow never left
him. From this he inferred that he went too
slowly, and ran as hard as he could without resting,
the consequence being that his strength broke
down and he died. He was not aware that by
going into the shade he would have got rid of his
shadow, and that by keeping still he would have
put an end to his footsteps. Fool that he was!</p>

<p>"Now you occupy yourself with charity and
duty to one's neighbour. You examine into the distinction
of like and unlike, the changes of motion
and rest, the canons of giving and receiving, the
emotions of love and hate, and the restraint of joy
and anger. Yet you cannot avoid the calamities
you speak of.</p>

<p>"Reverently care for your body. Carefully pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>serve
your natural purity. Leave externals to
others. Then you will not be involved. But as it
is, instead of improving yourself you are trying to
improve other people. Surely this is dealing with
the external."</p>

<p>"Then may I enquire," said Confucius in a tone
of distress, "what is the original purity?"</p>

<p>"Our original purity," replied the fisherman, "is
the perfection of truth unalloyed. Without this,
we cannot influence others. Hence, those who
weep to order, though they mourn, do not grieve.
Those who assume anger, though violent, do not
inspire awe. Those who affect friendship, though
they smile, are not in unison."</p>

<p>"Real mourning grieves in silence. Real anger
awes without expression. Real friendship is unison
without the aid of smiles. Our emotions are
dependent upon the original purity within; and
accordingly we hold the latter in esteem.</p>

<p>"If applied to human affairs, then in serving our
parents we are filial, in serving our prince we are
loyal, in the banquet hour we are merry, in the
hour of mourning we are sad.</p>

<p>"The object of loyalty is successful service; of
a banquet, mirth; of mourning, grief; of serving
parents, gratifying their wishes. If the service is
accomplished, it matters not that no trace remain.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the way of kudos to the accomplisher.</p></div>

<p>If parents be gratified, it matters not how. If a
banquet results in mirth, the accessories are of no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
importance. If there be real grief in mourning, it
matters not what ceremonies may be employed.</p>

<p>"Ceremonial is the invention of man. Our
original purity is given to us from God. It is as
it is, and cannot be changed. Wherefore the true
Sage models himself upon God, and holds his
original purity in esteem. He is independent of
human exigencies. Fools, however, reverse this.
They cannot model themselves upon God, and have
to fall back on man. They do not hold original
purity in esteem. Consequently they are ever
suffering the vicissitudes of mortality, and never
reaching the goal. Alas! you, Sir, were early
steeped in deceit, and are late in hearing the great
doctrine."</p>

<p>Confucius, having again prostrated himself twice,
arose and said,</p>

<p>"It has been a godsend to meet you, Sir, to-day.
Pray allow me to follow you as your servant, that
I may benefit by your teaching. I venture to ask
where you live that I may enter upon my duties
and learn the great doctrine."</p>

<p>"I have heard," replied the old man, "that if a
man is a fit companion, one may travel with him
into the uttermost depths of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. But that if he
is not a fit companion, and does not know <span class="smcap">Tao</span>,
one must avoid his company, that no harm may
befall. Excuse me, I must leave you." Thereupon
he pushed off his boat, and disappeared among the
reeds.</p>

<p>"Yen Yüan then brought up the chariot, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
Tzŭ Lu offered the hand-cord to Confucius. But
the latter paid no attention. He waited until the
ripples on the water had smoothed down and the
sound of the punt-pole had died away, before he
ventured to get up.</p>

<p>Tzŭ Lu, who was at the side of the chariot, enquired
saying, "Master, I have been in your service
now for a long time, yet never did I see you treat
any man like this. In the presence of a ruler of
ten thousand or a thousand chariots, I have never
seen you treated other than with great respect,
while you yourself would wear a haughty air. Yet
before this old fisherman, leaning on his punt-pole,
you cringe and bow and prostrate yourself twice
before answering. Is not this too much? The
disciples do not know what to make of it. Why
this behaviour to an old fisherman?"</p>

<p>"Yu!" cried Confucius, resting on the bar of
the chariot; "it is difficult to make anything of
you. You have long studied ceremonies and duty
to your neighbour, yet you have not succeeded in
getting rid of the old evil nature. Come here, and
I will tell you.</p>

<p>"To meet an elder without respect is want of
ceremony. To see a Sage and not to honour him,
is not to be in charity with man. Unless you are
in charity with man, you cannot humble yourself
before a fellow-creature. And unless you can
honestly do this, you can never attain to that state
of original purity; but the body will constantly
suffer. Alas! there is no greater evil than not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
be in charity with man. Yet in such a plight,
O Yu, are you.</p>

<p>"Further. <span class="smcap">Tao</span> is the source of all creation.
Men have it, and live. They lose it, and die.
Affairs in antagonism thereto, fail; in accordance
therewith, succeed. Therefore, wherever <span class="smcap">Tao</span>
abides, there is the reverence of the true Sage.
And as this old fisherman may be said to possess
<span class="smcap">Tao</span>, could I venture not to respect him?"</p>

<p>Lieh Yü K'ou, a name well known in connection
with <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. But it is extremely doubtful if such a
man ever lived. His record is not given by the
historian Ssŭ-ma Ch'ien, and he may well have
been no more than an allegorical personage created
by Chuang Tzŭ for purposes of illustration. It was
however thought necessary under the Han dynasty
to supply his "Works"; and the treatise thus provided
still passes under his name, though generally
regarded as a forgery. See pp. <a href="#Page_4">4</a>, <a href="#Page_5">5</a>.</p></div>

<p>went to Ch'i, half way there he turned round
and came back. Falling in with Poh Hun Wu
Jen, the latter said, "How is it you are so soon
back again?"</p>

<p>"I was afraid," replied Lieh Tzŭ.</p>

<p>"Afraid of what?" asked Poh Hun Wu Jen.</p>

<p>"Out of ten restaurants at which I ate," said
Lieh Tzŭ, "five would take no payment."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what is there to be afraid of in that?"
enquired Poh Hun Wu Jen.</p>

<p>"The truth within not being duly assimilated,"
replied Lieh Tzŭ, "a certain brightness is visible
externally. And to conquer men's hearts by force
of the external is to induce in oneself a disregard
for authority and age which is the precursor of
trouble.</p>

<p>"A restaurant keeper is one who lives by retailing
soup. When his returns are counted up, his
profit is but small, and his influence is next to
nothing. But if such a man could act thus, how
much more the ruler of a large State? His bodily
powers worn out in the duties of his position, his
mental powers exhausted by details of administration,
he would entrust me with the government
and stimulate me by reward. That is what I was
afraid of."</p>

<p>"Your inner lights are good," replied Poh Hun
Wu Jen; "but if you remain stationary at this
point, the world will still gather around you."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Contrary to <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p></div>

<p>Shortly afterwards Poh Hun Wu Jen went to
visit Lieh Tzŭ, and lo! his court-yard was filled
with boots.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of the visitors come to hear him. These were left
outside the door, in accordance with an ancient
custom mentioned in the <cite>Book of Rites</cite>. See p. <a href="#Page_368">368</a>.</p></div>

<p>Poh Hun Wu Jen stood there awhile, facing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>

staff. Then, without a word, he departed.</p>

<p>Upon this being announced to Lieh Tzŭ,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By the servant whose duty it was to receive guests.</p></div>

<p>he seized his shoes and ran out barefoot.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In his hurry.</p></div>

<p>When he reached the outer gate, he called aloud,
"Master! now that you have come, will you not
give me medicine?"</p>

<p>"It is all over!" cried Poh Hun Wu Jen. "I
told you that the world would gather around you.
It is not that you can make people gather around
you. You cannot prevent them from doing so.
Of what use would my instruction be? Exerting
influence thus unduly over others, you are by them

<p>There was a man of the Chêng State, named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
Huan. He pursued his studies at a place called
Ch'iu-shih. After three years only, he had graduated
as a Confucianist; and like a river which
fertilises its banks to a distance of nine <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i>, so did
his good influence reach into three families.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His father's, his mother's, and his wife's.</p></div>

<p>He caused his younger brother to graduate as a
Mihist. But inasmuch as in the question of Confucianism
<em>versus</em> Mihism,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The philosophy of Mih Tzŭ, who taught the doctrine
of universal love, etc. See pp. <a href="#Page_17">17</a>, <a href="#Page_440">440</a>.</p></div>

<p>the father took the side of the Mihist, at the end of
ten years Huan committed suicide.</p>

<p>Then the father dreamed that Huan appeared to
him and said, "It was I who caused your son to
become a Mihist. Why give all the credit to him
who is but as the fruit of an autumn pine?"</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Various interpretations of this simile are given:
none satisfactory. <i>E.g.</i> (1) Like a dry cone. (2)

does, but for what he is.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>I.e.</i> for the natural, not for the artificial.</p></div>

<p>And it was in this sense that the younger brother
was caused to become a Mihist.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He was naturally so inclined.</p></div>

<p>Whereas a man who should regard his distinctive
abilities as of his own making, without reference to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
his parents, would be like the man of Ch'i who
dug a well and then wanted to keep others away
from it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Forgetting that God put the spring there in the first

<p>Hence the saying that the men of to-day are all
Huans.</p>

<p>Wherefore it follows that men of true virtue are
unconscious of its possession. How much more
then the man of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>? This is what the ancients

<p>Chuang Tzŭ said, "To know <span class="smcap">Tao</span> is easy. The
difficulty lies in the elimination of speech. To know

<p>A man of the Sung State, named Ts'ao Shang,
acted as political agent for the prince of Sung at
the court of the Ch'in State. When he went
thither, he had a few carriages; but the prince of
Ch'in was so pleased with him that he added one
hundred more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>

<p>On his return to Sung, he visited Chuang Tzŭ

hovel, earning a scanty subsistence by making
sandals, with shrivelled face and yellow ears,&mdash;this
I could not do. Interviewing a powerful ruler,

forte."</p>

<p>"When the prince of Ch'in is sick," replied
Chuang Tzŭ, "and he summons his physician to
open a boil or cleanse an ulcer, the latter gets one
carriage. The man who licks his piles gets five.

number of carriages given. You, Sir, must have

<p>Confucius said, "The heart of man is more dangerous

periods of spring, summer, autumn, winter, day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>time

Others have abilities, yet appear to be worthless.
Others are compliant, yet gain their ends. Others
take a firm stand, yet yield the point. Others go
slow, yet advance quickly.</p>

<p>"Those who fly to duty towards their neighbour
as though thirsting after it, drop it as though
something hot. Thus the loyalty of the superior
man is tested by employing him at a distance, his
respectfulness by employing him near at hand.
His ability, by troublesome missions. His knowledge,
by unexpected questions. His trustworthiness,
by specification of time limits. His integrity
by entrusting him with money. His fidelity, by
dangerous tasks. His decorum, by filling him
with wine. His morality, by placing him in disreputable
surroundings. Under the application of
these nine tests, the inferior man stands revealed.</p>

<p>A man who had been to see the prince of Sung
and had been presented with ten chariots, was
putting on airs in the presence of Chuang Tzŭ.</p>

<p>"At Ho-Shang," said the latter, "there was a
poor man who supported his family by plaiting
rushes. One day his son dived into the river and
got a pearl worth a thousand ounces of silver.
The father bade him fetch a stone and smash it to
pieces, explaining that he could only have got such
a pearl very deep down from under the nose of the
dragon, which must have been asleep. And he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
said he was afraid that when the dragon waked,
the boy would have a poor chance.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If found with it in his possession.</p></div>

<p>"Now the State of Sung is deeper than a deep
river, and the prince of Sung is fiercer than a
dragon. To get these chariots, you must have
caught him asleep. And when he wakes, you will
be ground to powder."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some prince having invited Chuang Tzŭ to enter
his service, Chuang Tzŭ said in reply to the envoy,
"Sir, have you ever noticed a sacrificial ox? It is
bedecked with ribbons and fares sumptuously. But
when it comes to be slaughtered for the temple,
would it not gladly exchange places with some
neglected calf?"</p>

Ch'ien, in his biographical notice of Chuang Tzŭ.

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Chuang Tzŭ was about to die, his disciples
expressed a wish to give him a splendid
funeral. But Chuang Tzŭ said, "With Heaven
and Earth for my coffin and shell; with the sun,
moon, and stars as my burial regalia; and with all
creation to escort me to the grave,&mdash;are not my
funeral paraphernalia ready to hand?"</p>

<p>"We fear," argued the disciples, "lest the carrion
kite should eat the body of our Master"; to
which Chuang Tzŭ replied, "Above ground I
shall be food for kites; below I shall be food for
mole-crickets and ants. Why rob one to feed
the other?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>With this may be compared the reply of Diogenes
on a similar occasion. When the old cynic asked
to be left unburied, his friends objected that he would
be eaten by dogs and birds.</p>

<p>"Place my staff near me," said Diogenes, "that I
may drive them away."</p>

<p>"How will you manage that?" enquired the friends.
"You will not be conscious."</p>

beasts," cried Diogenes, "if I am not conscious
of it?"</p></div>

<p>"If you adopt, as absolute, a standard of evenness
which is so only relatively, your results will
not be absolutely even. If you adopt, as absolute,
a criterion of right which is so only relatively, your
results will not be absolutely right. Those who
trust to their senses become slaves to objective
existences. Those alone who are guided by their
intuitions find the true standard. So far are the
senses less reliable than the intuitions. Yet fools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
trust to their senses to know what is good for
mankind, with alas! but external results."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">The Empire.</span></p>

<p class="ph4">[Summary by early editors.]</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Systems</span> of government are many. Each
man thinks his own perfect. Where then
does what the ancients called the system of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>
come in? There is nowhere where it does not
come in.</p>

<p>It may be asked whence our spirituality, whence
our intellectuality. The true Sage is born; the
prince is made. Yet all proceed from an original
<span class="smcap">One</span>.</p>

<p>He who does not separate from the Source is
one with God. He who does not separate from
the essence is a spiritual man. He who does not
separate from the reality is a perfect man. He who
makes God the source, and <span class="smcap">Tê</span> the root, and <span class="smcap">Tao</span>
the portal, passively falling in with the modifications
of his environment,&mdash;he is the true Sage.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These are but four different denominations of the
ideal man.</p></div>

<p>He who practises charity as a kindness, duty to
one's neighbour as a principle, ceremony as a convenience,
music as a pacificator, and thus becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
compassionate and charitable,&mdash;he is a superior
man.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We sink here to a lower level, though still a high
one. The "superior man" is the ideal man of
Confucian ethics. In him divinity finds no place.</p></div>

<p>He who regulates his conduct by law, who regards
fame as an external adjunct, who verifies his
hypotheses, who bases his judgment upon proof,&mdash;such
men rank one, two, three, four, etc. It is thus
that officials rank. In a strict sense of duty, in
making food and raiment of paramount importance,
in caring for and nourishing the old, the weak, the
orphan, and the widow, they all exemplify the
principle of true government.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Partly, if not wholly. This the dead level of ordinary
mortality, still within the operation of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p></div>

<p>Thus far-reaching was the extension of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>
among the ancients.</p>

<p>The companion of the gods, the purifier of the
universe, it nourishes all creation, it unites the
empire, it benefits the masses. Illuminating the
fundamental, it is bound up with the accessory,
reaching to all points of the compass and to the
opposite extremes of magnitude. There is indeed
nowhere where it is not!</p>

<p>How it enlightened the polity of past ages is
evidenced in the records which historians have
preserved to us. Its presence in the Canons of
<em>Poetry</em>, <em>History</em>, <em>Rites</em>, and <em>Music</em>, has been made
clear by many scholars of Chou and Lu. It in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>forms
the Canon of <em>Poetry</em> with its vigour, the
Canon of <em>History</em> with its usefulness, the Canon
of <em>Rites</em> with its adaptability, the Canon of <em>Music</em>
with its harmonising influence, the Canon of
<em>Changes</em> with its mysterious Principles, and the
<em>Spring and Autumn</em> with its discriminations.
Spread over the whole world, it is focussed in the
Middle Kingdom, and the learning of all schools
renders constant homage to its power.</p>

<p>But when the world is disorganised, true Sages
do not manifest themselves, <span class="smcap">Tao</span> ceases to exist as
<span class="smcap">One</span>, and the world becomes cognisant of the idiosyncrasies
of the individual. These are like the
senses of hearing, sight, smell, and taste,&mdash;not
common to each organ. Or like the skill of various
artisans,&mdash;each excellent of its kind and each useful
in its turn, but not equally at the command of all.</p>

<p>Consequently, when a mere specialist comes forward
and dogmatises on the beauty of the universe
the principles which underlie all creation, the position
occupied by the ancients in reference to the
beauty of the universe, and the limits of the supernatural,&mdash;it
follows that the <span class="smcap">Tao</span> of inner wisdom
and of outer strength is obscured and prevented
from asserting itself. Every one alas! regards the
course he prefers as the infallible course. The
various schools diverge never to meet again; and
posterity is debarred from viewing the original
purity of the universe and the grandeur of the
ancients. For the system of <span class="smcap">Tao</span> is scattered in
fragments over the face of the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<p>Not to covet posthumous fame, nor to aim at
dazzling the world, nor to pose as a benefactor of
mankind, but to be a strict self-disciplinarian while
lenient to the faults of others,&mdash;herein lay the <span class="smcap">Tao</span>
of the ancients.</p>

<p>Mih Tzŭ and Ch'in Hua Li</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A disciple of Mih Tzŭ.</p></div>

<p>became enthusiastic followers of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, but they
pushed the system too far, carrying their practice
to excess. The former wrote an essay <cite>Against
Music</cite>, and another which he entitled <cite>Economy</cite>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To be found in the collection which passes under the
name of Mih Tzŭ.</p></div>

<p>There was to be no singing in life, no mourning
after death. He taught universal love and beneficence
towards one's fellow men, without contentions,
without censure of others. He loved learning, but
not in order to become different from others. Yet
his views were not those of the ancient Sages,
whose music and rites he set aside.</p>

<p>The Yellow Emperor gave us the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Hsien-ch'ih</i>.
Yao gave us the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Ta-chang</i>. Shun, the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Ta-shao</i>.
Yü, the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Ta-hsia</i>. T'ang, the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Ta-hu</i>. Wên Wang,
the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">P'i-yung</i>. Wu Wang and Chou Kung added
the <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">Wu</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Famous musical compositions.</p></div>

<p>The mourning ceremonial of old was according
to the estate of each, and determined in proportion
to rank. Thus, the body of the Son of Heaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
was enclosed in a seven-fold coffin. That of a
feudal prince, in a five-fold coffin. That of a
minister, in a three-fold coffin. That of a private
individual, in a two-fold coffin. But now Mih Tzŭ
would have no singing in life, no mourning after
death, and a single coffin of only three inches in
thickness as the rule for all alike!</p>

<p>Such doctrines do not illustrate his theory of
universal love;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They betray a want of sympathy with human weaknesses.</p></div>

<p>neither does his practice of them establish the fact
of his own personal self-respect. They may not
suffice to destroy his system altogether; though it
is unreasonable to prohibit singing, and weeping,
and rejoicing in due season.</p>

<p>He would have men toil through life and hold
death in contempt. But this teaching is altogether
too unattractive. It would land mankind in sorrow
and lamentation. It would be next to impossible
as a practical system, and cannot, I fear, be regarded
as the <span class="smcap">Tao</span> of the true Sage. It would be
diametrically opposed to human passions, and as
such would not be tolerated by the world. Mih
Tzŭ himself might be able to carry it out; but not
the rest of the world. And when one separates
from the rest of the world, his chances of developing
an ideal State become small indeed.</p>

<p>Mih Tzŭ argued in favour of his system as
follows:&mdash;Of old, the great Yü drained off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
flood of waters, and caused rivers and streams to
flow through the nine divisions of the empire and
the parts adjacent thereto,&mdash;three hundred great
rivers, three thousand branches, and streams without
number. With his own hands he plied the
bucket and dredger, in order to reduce confusion
to uniformity,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Make all streams flow to the sea.</p></div>

<p>until his calves and shins had no hair left upon
them. The wind bathed him, the rain combed
him; but he marked out the nations of the world,
and was in very truth a Sage. And because he
thus sacrificed himself to the commonwealth, ages
of Mihists to come would also wear short serge
jackets and straw sandals, and toil day and night
without stopping, making self-mortification their
end and aim, and say to themselves, "If we cannot
do this, we do not follow the <span class="smcap">Tao</span> of Yü, and are
unworthy to be called Mihists."</p>

<p>The disciples of Hsiang Li Ch'in,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A professor of Mihism.</p></div>

<p>the followers of the five princes, Mihists of the
south, such as K'u Huo, Chi Ch'ih, and Têng
Ling,&mdash;all these studied the canon of Mih Tzŭ,
but their disagreements and agreements were not
identical. They called each other schismatics, and
quarrelled over the "hard and white," the "like
and unlike," and argued over questions of "odd
and even." Chü Tzŭ was their Sage, and they
wanted to canonise him as a saint, that they might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
carry on his doctrines into after ages. Even now
these differences are not settled.</p>

<p>Thus we see that Mih Tzŭ and Ch'in Hua Li,
while right in theory, were wrong in practice.
They would merely have taught mankind to vie
with each other in working the hair off their calves
and shins. The evil of that system would have
predominated over the good. Nevertheless, Mih
Tzŭ was undoubtedly a well-meaning man. In
spite of failure, with all its withering influences, he
stuck to his text. He may be called a man of
genius.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But not a true Sage.</p></div>

<p>Not to be involved in the mundane, not to
indulge in the specious, not to be overreaching
with the individual, nor antagonistic to the public;
but to desire the tranquillity of the world in general
with a view to the prolongation of life, to seek no
more than sufficient for the requirements of oneself
and others, and by such a course to purify the
heart,&mdash;herein lay the <span class="smcap">Tao</span> of the ancients.</p>

<p>Sung Hsing and Yin Wên became enthusiastic
followers of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. They adopted a cap, shaped like
the Hua Mountain, as a badge. They bore themselves
with kindly discrimination towards all
things. They spoke of the passive qualities of the
heart as though they had been active; and declared
that whosoever could bring joy among mankind
and peace within the girdle of ocean should be
made ruler over them.</p>

<p>They suffered obloquy without noticing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
insult. They preserved the people from strife.
They prohibited aggression and caused arms to lie
unused. They saved their generation from wars,
and carried their system over the whole empire, to
the delight of the high and to the improvement of
the lowly. Though the world would have none of
them, yet they struggled on and would not give
way. Hence it was said that when high and low
became tired of seeing them, they intruded themselves
by force. In spite of all this, they did too
much for others, and too little for themselves.</p>

<p>"Give us," said they, "but five pints of rice, and
it will be enough." The master could not thus eat
his fill; but the disciples, although starving, did
not forget the world's claims.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is not satisfactorily explained by any commentator.
Kuo Hsiang says that these two men
regarded the world as their "master."</p></div>

<p>Day and night they toiled on, saying, "Must we
necessarily live? Shall we ape the so-called
saviours of mankind?"</p>

<p>"The superior man," they say, "is not a fault-finder.
He does not appropriate the credit of
others. He looks on one who does no good to the
world as a worthless fellow. He regards prohibition
of aggressive actions and causing arms to lie
unused, as external; the diminution and restraint
of our passions, as internal. In all matters, great
or small, subtle or gross, such is the point to
which he attains."</p>

<p>To be public-spirited and belong to no party, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
one's dealings not to be all for self, to move without
being bound to a given course, to take things
as they come, to have no remorse for the past, no
anxiety for the future, to have no partialities, but
to be on good terms with all,&mdash;herein lay the <span class="smcap">Tao</span>
of the ancients.</p>

<p>P'êng Mêng, T'ien P'ien, and Shên Tao, became
enthusiastic followers of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. Their criterion was
the identity of all things. "The sky," said they,
"can cover but cannot support us. The earth can
support but cannot cover us. <span class="smcap">Tao</span> can embrace all
things but cannot deal with particulars."</p>

<p>They knew that in creation all things had their
possibilities and their impossibilities. Therefore
they said, "Selection excludes universality. Training
will not reach in all directions. But <span class="smcap">Tao</span> is
comprehensive."</p>

<p>Consequently, Shên Tao discarded all knowledge
and self-interest and became a fatalist.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is about as difficult to apprehend <span class="smcap">Tao</span> apart from
fatalism as the omniscience of God apart from predestination.</p></div>

<p>Passivity was his guiding principle. "For," said
he, "we can only know that we know nothing, and
a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.</p>

<p>"Take any worthless fellow who laughs at mankind
for holding virtue in esteem, any unprincipled
vagabond who reviles the great Sages of the world,
and subject him to torture. In his agony he will
sacrifice positive and negative alike. If he can but
get free, he will trouble no more about knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
and forethought. Past and future will cease to
exist for him, in his then neutral condition.</p>

<p>"Move when pushed, come when dragged. Be
like a whirling gale, like a feather in the wind, like
a mill-stone going round. The mill-stone as an
existence is perfectly harmless. In motion or at
rest it does no more than is required, and cannot
therefore incur blame.</p>

<p>"Why? Because it is simply an inanimate
thing. It has no anxieties about itself. It is never
entangled in the trammels of knowledge. In motion
or at rest it is always governed by fixed laws, and
therefore it never becomes open to praise. Hence
it has been said, 'Be as though an inanimate
thing, and there will be no use for Sages.'</p>

<p>"For a clod cannot be without <span class="smcap">Tao</span>,"&mdash;at which
some full-blooded young buck covered the argument
with ridicule by crying out, "Shên Tao's
<span class="smcap">Tao</span> is not for the living, but for the dead!"</p>

<p>It was the same with T'ien P'ien. He studied
under P'êng Mêng; with the result that he learnt
nothing.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Tao</span> cannot be learnt.</p></div>

<p>P'êng Mêng's tutor said, "Those of old who
knew <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, reached the point where positive and
negative ceased to exist. That was all."</p>

<p>Now the bent of these men is one of opposition,
which it is difficult to discuss. They act in every
way differently from other people, but cannot escape
the imputation of purpose.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Which takes the place of spontaneity.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>

<p>What they call Tao is not <span class="smcap">Tao</span>; and what they
predicate affirmatively cannot escape being negative.
The fact is that P'êng Mêng, T'ien P'ien, and Shên
Tao, did not know <span class="smcap">Tao</span>. Nevertheless they all had
a certain acquaintance with it.</p>

<p>To make the root the essential, to regard objective
existences as accidental, to look upon accumulation
as deficiency, and to meekly accept the dispositions
of Providence,&mdash;herein lay the <span class="smcap">Tao</span> of the
ancients.</p>

<p>Kuan Yin and Lao Tzŭ became enthusiastic
followers of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For Kuan Yin, see p. <a href="#Page_230">230</a>.</p></div>

<p>They based their system upon nothingness, with
<span class="smcap">One</span> as their criterion. Their outward expression
was gentleness and humility. Their inward belief
was in unreality and avoidance of injury to all
things.</p>

<p>Kuan Yin said, "Adopt no absolute position.
Let externals take care of themselves. In motion,
be like water. At rest, like a mirror.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Receptive, but not permanently so.</p></div>

<p>Respond, like the echo.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Only when called upon.</p></div>

<p>Be subtle, as though non-existent. Be still, as
though pure. Regard uniformity as peace. Look
on gain as loss. Do not precede others. Follow
them."</p>

<p>Lao Tzŭ said, "He who conscious of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
strong, is content to be weak,&mdash;he shall be
a cynosure of men.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is quoted by Huai Nan Tzŭ as a saying by Lao
Tzŭ, and appears in ch. xxviii of the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>.
See <cite>The Remains of Lao Tzŭ</cite>, p. 21.</p></div>

<p>"He who conscious of purity, puts up with disgrace,&mdash;he
shall be the cynosure of mankind.</p>

<p>"He who when others strive to be first, contents
himself with the lowest place, is said to accept the
contumely of the world.</p>

<p>"He who when others strive for the substantial,
contents himself with the unsubstantial, stores up
nothing and therefore has abundance. There he
is in the midst of his abundance which comes to
him without effort on his part. He does nothing,
and laughs at the artifices of others.</p>

<p>"He who when others strive for happiness is
content with security, is said to aim at avoiding evil.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Compare the <cite>Tao-Tê-Ching</cite>, ch. xxii.</p></div>

<p>"He who makes depth of fundamental importance
and moderation his rule of life, is said to
crush that which is hard within him and temper
that which is sharp.</p>

<p>"To be in liberal sympathy with all creation,
and not to be aggressive towards one's fellow-men,&mdash;this
may be called perfection."</p>

<p>O Kuan Yin! O Lao Tzŭ! verily ye were the
true Sages of old.</p>

<p>Silence, formlessness, change, impermanence, now
life, now death, heaven and earth blended in one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
the soul departing, gone no one knows where:
suddenly, no one knows whither, as all things go
in turn, never to come back again;&mdash;herein lay the
<span class="smcap">Tao</span> of the ancients.</p>

<p>Chuang Tzŭ became an enthusiastic follower of
<span class="smcap">Tao</span>. In strange terms, in bold words, in far-reaching
language, he gave free play to his
thoughts, without following any particular school
or committing himself to any particular line.</p>

<p>He looked on the world as so sunk in corruption
that it was impossible to speak gravely. Therefore
he employed "goblet words" which apply in
various directions; he based his statements upon
weighty authority in order to inspire confidence;
and he put words in other people's mouths in order
to secure breadth.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See <a href="#Page_363">ch. xxvii</a> <i>ad init.</i></p></div>

<p>In accord with the spirit of the universe, he was at
peace with all creation. He judged not the rights
and wrongs of mankind, and thus lived quietly in
his generation. Although his book is an extraordinary
production, it is plausible and harmless
enough. Although the style is most irregular, it
is at the same time ingenious and attractive.</p>

<p>As a thinker, he is endlessly suggestive. Above,
he roams with God. Below, he consorts with those
who are beyond the pale of life and death, who deny
a beginning and an end. In relation to the root,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The origin of all things.</p></div>

<p>he speaks on a grand and extensive scale. In relation
to <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, he establishes a harmony between man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
and the higher powers. Nevertheless, he yields to
the modifications of existence and responds to the
exigencies of environment. His arguments are
inexhaustible, and never illogical. He is far-reaching,
mysterious, and not to be fully explored.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is impossible for a European critic to believe that
Chuang Tzŭ penned the above paragraphs. See
<i>post</i>, p. <a href="#Page_454">454</a>.</p></div>

<p>Hui Tzŭ was a man of many ideas. His works
would fill five carts. But his doctrines are paradoxical,
and his terms are used ambiguously.</p>

<p>He calls infinite greatness, beyond which there
is nothing, the Greater One. He calls infinite
smallness, within which there is nothing, the
Lesser One.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Recognising two absolute extremes.</p></div>

<p>He says that that which is without dimensions
measures a thousand <i lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">li</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the principle that mathematical points, though
themselves without dimensions, collectively fill up
space.</p></div>

<p>That heaven and earth are equally low. That
mountain and marsh are equally level.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It depends upon the point of view.</p></div>

<p>That the sun at noon is the sun setting.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To people living farther east.</p></div>

<p>That when an animal is born, it dies.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As regards its previous state it dies when leaving it
for a new state.</p></div>

<p>That the likeness of things partly unlike is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
the lesser likeness of unlikes. That the likeness of
things altogether unlike is called the greater likeness
of unlikes. That southwards there is no
limit, and yet there is a limit. That one can reach
Yüeh to-day and yet be there before. That joined
rings can be separated. That the middle of the
world is north of Yen and south of Yüeh.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is wherever the speaker is. The space between
Yen and Yüeh is as zero compared with the infinite.</p></div>

<p>That he loves all creation equally, just as heaven
and earth are impartial to all.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In covering and supporting all.</p></div>

<p>Accordingly, Hui Tzŭ was regarded as a great
philosopher and a very subtle dialectician; and
became a favourite with the other dialecticians of
the day.</p>

<p>He said that there were feathers in an egg.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Because on a chicken.</p></div>

<p>That a fowl had three feet.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The third being <em>volition</em>.</p></div>

<p>That Ying was the world.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As you cannot say it is not the world.</p></div>

<p>That a dog could be a sheep. That a mare could
lay eggs. That a nail has a tail.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Names being arbitrary in all cases.</p></div>

<p>That fire is not hot.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is the man who feels it hot.</p></div>

<p>That mountains have mouths.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As evidenced by echoes.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<p>That wheels do not press down the ground.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Touching only at a point.</p></div>

<p>That the eye does not see.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is the man.</p></div>

<p>That the finger does not touch. That the uttermost
extreme is not the end. That a tortoise is
longer than a snake.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Because longer lived!</p></div>

<p>That a carpenter's square is not square.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Like Horace's Whetstone which makes other things
sharp, "exsors ipsa secandi."</p></div>

<p>That compasses will not make a circle.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is the draughtsman.</p></div>

<p>That a round hole will not surround a square
handle. That the shadow of a flying bird does not
move. That there is a moment when a swiftly-flying
arrow is neither moving nor at rest. That
a dog is not a hound.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Two things cannot be identical unless even their
names are the same.</p></div>

<p>That a bay horse and a dun cow are three.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Taken separately they are two. Taken together they
are one. One and two make three.</p></div>

<p>That a white dog is black.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If his eyes are black. Part standing for the whole.</p></div>

<p>That a motherless colt never had a mother.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When it had a mother, it was not an orphan.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span></p>

<p>That if you take a stick a foot long and every day
cut it in half, you will never come to the end of it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Compare "Achilles and the Tortoise," and the
sophisms of the Greek philosophers.</p></div>

<p>And such was the stuff which dialecticians used to
argue about with Hui Tzŭ, also without ever
getting to the end of it.</p>

<p>Huan T'uan and Kung Sun Lung were of this
class. By specious premisses they imposed on
people's minds and drove them into false conclusions.
But though they won the battle in
words, they did not carry conviction into their
adversaries' hearts. Theirs were but the snares of
the sophist.</p>

<p>Hui Tzŭ daily devoted his intelligence to such
pursuits, purposely advancing some preposterous
thesis upon which to dispute. That was his characteristic.
He had besides a great opinion of his
own wisdom, and used to say, "The universe does
not hold my peer."</p>

<p>Hui Tzŭ makes a parade of his strength, but is
devoid of any sound system. An eccentric fellow
in the south, named Huang Liao, asked why the
sky did not fall and the earth sink; also, whence
came wind, rain, and thunder.</p>

<p>Hui Tzŭ was not backward in replying to these
questions, which he answered unhesitatingly. He
went into a long discussion on all creation, and
talked away without end, though to himself he
seemed to be saying very little. He supplemented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
this with most extraordinary statements, making
it his chief object to contradict others, and being
desirous of gaining fame by defeating all comers.
Thus, he was never popular. Morally, he was
weak; physically, he was violent. His was a dark
and narrow way.</p>

<p>Looked at from the point of view of the <span class="smcap">Tao</span> of
the universe, the value of Hui Tzŭ may be compared
with the efforts of a mosquito or a gadfly.
Of what use was he to the world? As a specialist,
he might have succeeded. But to let him put
himself forward as an exponent of <span class="smcap">Tao</span>, would
have been dangerous indeed.</p>

<p>He would not however be content to be a
specialist. He must needs roam insatiably over all
creation, though he only succeeded in securing the
reputation of a sophist.</p>

<p>Alas for the talents of Hui Tzŭ! He is extravagantly
energetic, and yet has no success. He
investigates all creation, but does not conclude in
<span class="smcap">Tao</span>. He makes a noise to drown an echo. He
is like a man running a race with his own shadow.
Alas!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As to the genuineness of this concluding chapter,
every one may form his own opinion. The question
has been hotly fought, and great names could be
mentioned on each side. Wang An Shih and Su
Tung P'o both thought that it might well have come
from the hand of Chuang Tzŭ. Lin Hsi Chung
thought not, and on his side the majority of Western
students will in all probability be ranged.</p></div>

to love the people is the," &amp;c. Neither rendering
is quite satisfactory; for reasons which would
require quotations from the Chinese text.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
